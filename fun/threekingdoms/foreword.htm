<p>• "The peach trees in the orchard behind the house are
just in full flower. Tomorrow we will institute a sacrifice there and solemnly
declare our intention before Heaven and Earth. And we three will swear
brotherhood and unity of aims and sentiments; thus will we enter upon our great
task."---Chapter 1---Zhang Fei suggested the oath of brotherhood to
Liu Bei and Guan Yu.


<p>• "The world can do without Cao Hong, but not
without you, my lord!"---Chapter 6---when his general Cao Hong
yielded his horse to Cao Cao, who was pursued by Lu Bu's
army.


<p>• "He is far abler than I and fully equal to the task of
ruling. Should he have doubts upon internal affairs, he must turn to
Zhang Zhao; for outer matters he must consult
Zhou Yu."---Chapter 29---said Sun Ce of his brother
Sun Quan.


<p>• Liu Bei wept. "If you will not, O Master, what
will become of the people?"---Chapter 38---Liu Bei was pleading
Zhuge Liang to aid him in restoring the empire.


<p>• "General, if you will accept me, I will render what
trifling service I can."---Chapter 38---Zhuge Liang yielded to
Liu Bei's call.


<p>• "A fierce wild beast: If he comes, his prey will be
humans!"---Chapter 3---said Zheng Tai of Dong Zhuo, who was
approaching the capital with a huge army.


<p>• "Do not fear, my father! I look upon all the lords
beyond the passes as so much stubble. And with the warriors of our fierce army,
I will put every one of them to death and hang their heads at the gates of the
capital."---Chapter 5---Lu Bu showed his awe over the lords who
were rebelling against Dong Zhuo.


<p>• "With your aid I can sleep secure!"---Chapter
5---Dong Zhuo was fully confident in his adopted son Lu Bu.


<p>• When Lu Bu was very mellow, Wang Yun
suddenly said, "Let her come in!" Soon appeared two attendants, dressed in white, 
leading between them the exquisite and fascinating Diao Chan.
---Chapter 8---Diao Chan entered politics.


<p>• Guan Yu quickly mounted, turned down his mighty weapon,
and galloped down the hill; his phoenix eyes rounded, and his silkworm eyebrows
fiercely bristling. He dashed straight into the enemy's array, and the northern
soldiers opened like falling waves and dissolving storms. He made directly for
the commander.---Chapter 25---The hero plunged into battlefield.


<p>• As the men of Cas Cao came pressing on, Zhao Yun
drew Cas Cao's own sword to beat them off. Nothing could resist the Blue
Blade Sword. Armor, clothing, it went through without effort and blood gushed
forth in fountains wherever it struck. So the four generals were soon beaten
off, and Zhao Yun was once again free.---Chapter 41---Zhao Yun
triumped against a myriad army.


<p>• Tao Qian reluctantly sent the army out. From a distance
he saw Cas Cao's army spread abroad like frost and rushed far and wide
like snow. In their midst was a large white flag and on both sides was written
"Vengeance".---Chapter 10---Cas Cao marched to Xuzhou.


<p>• Yu Jin rode forward shouting at the top of his voice,
"Halt the train!" Xiahou Dun saw him coming up and asked what was the
matter. Yu Jin said, "The roads here are narrow and difficult. Around
us are thick forests. What if they use fire?" Xiahou Dun's ferocity had
then somewhat abated and he turned his steed toward his main army. Then there
arose a shout behind him. A rushing noise came from in the reeds and great
tongues of flame shot up here and there. These spread and soon the fire was in
"the four quarters and the eight sides," and fanned by a strong
wind.---Chapter 39---Zhuge Liang's first battle.


<p>• Zhou Yu said to Zhuge Liang, "I hold a sacred trust from my lord, 
Sun Ce. I would not bow the knee to any such as Cao Cao. What I said just now 
was to see how you stood. I left Poyang Lake with the intention of 
attacking the north, and nothing can change that intention, 
not even the sword at my breast or the ax on my neck."---Chapter 44---Zhou Yu, 
the guardian of the south.


<p>• Huang Gai took his place on the third ship. He merely
wore breast armor and carried a keen blade. On his flag were written four large
characters "Van Leader Huang Gai". With a fair wind his fleet
sailed toward the Red Cliffs.---Chapter 49---The start of the battle of Red
Cliffs.


<p>• With a cry, Ma Chao set his spear and rode over
toward Cas Cao as if to slay him. But Yu Jin came out from behind
and engaged Ma Chao in battle. These two fought some half score bouts,
and then Yu Jin had to flee. Zhang He, however, took his place
and the two warriors exchanged twenty passes. Then Zhang He, too, ran
away. Next to come forth was Li Tong. Ma Chao's martial prowess was
now at its height, and he made short work of Li Tong, who went out of the
saddle at the first blow. Then Ma Chao flourished his spear at the troops
behind him as a signal for them to come on, which they did like a flood. They
overwhelmed Cas Cao's forces, and Ma Chao, Pang De, and
Ma Dai rode forward to try to capture Cas Cao.---Chapter
58---Ma Chao in the battlefield.


<p>• Sun Quan and Liu Bei stood both entranced by
the beautiful scene. And gradually along the vast river the wind whipped the
waves into snowy foam and raised them high toward heaven. And in the midst of
the waves appeared a tiny leaf of a boat riding over the waves as if all was
perfect calm. "The northern people are riders and the southern people
sailors; it is said quite true," sighed Liu Bei.---Chapter
54---Liu Bei visited the South Land.


<p>• The last night he spent in Jizhou, Cas Cao went
to the eastern corner tower and stood there regarding the sky. His only
companion was Xun You. Presently Cas Cao said, "That is a
very brilliant glow there in the south. It seems too strong for me to do
anything there." "What is there that can oppose your heaven-high
prestige?" said Xun You.---Chapter 34---The southern awe.
