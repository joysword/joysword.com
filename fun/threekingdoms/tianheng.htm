<p><b>Tian Heng Island</b>
 
<p>Tian Heng Island sits at the north side of Laoshan Gulf to the east of Qingdao city. Its central position is on the 36°25' 08" N, 20°57' 32". The total size of it is about 1.4 square km. The island, richly endowed by the history, owns many relic resources and a strong cultural basis.

<p>Tian Heng was originally a noble warrior in the State of Qi in Warring States Period. The State of Qin unified China, ending the Warring State Period. But the Qin dynasty lasted for only 2 generations. At the end of the second generation Chen Sheng led the peasants revolting against the King. Tian Heng was quick enough to see this as the best chance to regain the lost land of his mother country (the Qi state).

<p>He and his brothers Tian Zhan and Tian Rong immediately rose up against the King. They significantly expanded the power of Qi state. But later Qi was involved in the civil war between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang. At first Liu Bang allied with Qi but betrayed her later. So Qi had to fight with Liu Bang together with Xiang Yu. After many bloody battles and shameful betrayals, Liu Bang at last gained the upper wind and destroyed the troops of both Xiang Yu and Qi state.

<p>In the battle of Weishui, the king of Qi, Tian Guang, was killed, so Tian Heng had to take up the weak throne and fight perseveringly with Liu Bang to the last minute with his loyal soldiers left unkilled.
  
<p>Scared by the courage of Tian Heng, willing to seek a quick solution, Liu Bang at last sent an ultimatum to Tian Heng. He declared: "If Tian Heng submits to me, he will either become a state governor or a high-rank noble; otherwise I will send a large troop to erase him and his small group of soldier from the world."

<p>But Tian Heng's answer is definitely no. At that time he and his 500 men were hiding in the now called "Tian Heng" island. It was clear that, if they stayed on the island and resist to the last minute, the island would be their tomb. But no one complained about his fate.

<p>But King Liu Bang insisted on calling Tian Heng to talk with him. If he would not come, the King will eradicate his troop on the island. In order to make his men survive, Tian Heng went to see the king with his two assistants. When they were near the capital, he said to his staff: "The king Liu Bang wants to see me, that means he wants to see what I look like. So you just take my head to him. It's not far away from the capital, the appearance of my head will not change much." Then he cut his head by himself.

<p>When Liu Bang saw the head of Tian Heng, he was overwhelmed by the courage of this great fighter. He sent the two assistants back to tell the 500 soldiers of their lord's death and the king's intention to forgive them and accept them into the king's troop. However, knowing that their commander was dead, the 500 loyal followers cut their own throat with swords.

<p>The local people collected their remains and buried them together. Later, someone was impressed by the loyalty and courage of these warriors and their leader Tian Heng and set up temples to commemorate them.

<p>Now there are around 200 families living on that island, farming and fishing. Tian Heng Island has beautiful mountains and rivers, and owns enchanting scenery. Until now, there still sit the tombs of 500 martyrs and many exciting stories spread among the local citizens. On the island, there are such scenic spots as "Sunrise On the Snail Top", "Dragon Soldiers Crossing the Sea", "Sunset-bathed Heng Door". Still there are other attractions: Tian Heng Statue, Tian Heng Ancestral Temple, Clay Figures of Warriors and Horses, Cave of Sea Queen, Mass of Blackwood Sculptures, etc. With fantastic rocks and beautiful water, Tian Heng Island is one of the most attracting places for water-sports items like fishing, swimming, sailboating and motorboating. It is also the first-considered site for many activities such as annual Beer Festival, Picture-taking Competition, Fishing Festival, Oriental Cherry Journey and Mazu Temple Fairs.

<p>San Lian Company Group has invested more than 100 million Yuan RMB to improve the Tian Heng Island's basic facilities. Now the solid traffic net of sea-land-air has been formed. The large tree-planting project has been completed. Now there are more than 50 buildings, such as Chinese Garden, Nine Dragons House, Sea-dream Garden, and Villa Zone. Moreover, to come to the need of the reception, there is an entertainment center, 7 clubs and other facilities. But there remain a lot of Qi Lu cultural traditions and the local ancient fishing traditions and customs.
