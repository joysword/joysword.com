        People now have access to a rapidly growing number of data
        sources from the web/cloud which are getting augmented with
        personal sensors (e.g. www.bodymedia.com) which now commonly
        talk to mobile phones or web pages. We are going to look at
        designing an interface to make this kind of data and more
        available on your bathroom mirror, which could act as a large
        display surface that we commonly use each day.<br

      My expectation here is not that you will produce something that
      looks as good as a professional graphic designer, but that you
      will apply the basic rules of visual design to design an effective
      interface to communicate with the user.<br>
      <br>
      This project has two phases each with their own due date:<br>
    </div>

        <li>a. final sketch - due 3/16 at 9pm Chicago time<br>

      You will be working in groups. Due to the class size, the group
      size will be 3 or 4 people, which will give us 7 or 8 groups. You
      will need to choose your team, and email me the member names by
      2/9. I will randomly assign the remaining students to teams before
      the next class. If you only have a partial team (2 people, 3
      people) that's OK, I can randomly assign people to fill in, or mix
      and match partial teams. <br>

        phase</span><br>
      <br>
      In this phase you are going to think about the user interface to a
      bathroom mirror that has been combined with a display screen,
      speakers, and possibly cameras and microphones. Think of something
      like a large thin-border LCD TV with a half-silvered mirror in
      front of it so it continues to reflect the user's image while
      being able to simultaneously display computer generated graphics.
      Its main function is to still act like a mirror, but while you are
      in front of the mirror the mirror will give you additional
      information. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Some of the general information that the mirror will provide are<br>
      <ul>
        <li>personalized calendar events for today</li>
        <li>personalized news feed items and social feed items<br>
        </li>
        <li>clock<br>
        </li>
        <li>weather</li>
      </ul>
      The mirror should also provide health-related information such as<br>
      <ul>
        <li>how long you slept last night and how much was deep / REM /
          light sleep</li>
        <li>your current weight (assuming a scale on/in the floor) and
          how it relates to your recent weight</li>
        <li>how many steps you took yesterday, and how that relates to
          your recent totals</li>
        <li>how many calories you burned yesterday</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Some other things the system could do<br>
      <ul>
        <li>play music when you are brushing your teeth or in the shower
          - how do you control the playlist?</li>
        <li>have a camera to help detect skin cancer by taking photos at
          regular intervals and comparing them - lots of privacy issues
          here</li>
        <li>show you how many calories you ate yesterday (assuming you
          have a way of tracking that) or even more detailed nutritional
          information about what you have eaten recently<br>
        </li>
        <li>show that it has recognized you and then welcomes you<br>
        </li>
        <li>act as a light source<br>
        </li>
        <li>allow the user to customize the display - e.g. the widget
          sizes and locations</li>
        <li>and you are definitely encouraged to add ideas of your own<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Some initial questions:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>how long do you spend in front of the mirror in the morning
          and evening?<br>
        </li>
        <li>does the mirror talk?<br>
        </li>
        <li>if you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night what
          should the mirror do?<br>
        </li>
        <li>how does the mirror recognize you to show your data (camera
          recognition? voice? touching an icon?)</li>
        <li>if there are multiple people in the bathroom at the same
          time how does the system split up the display space</li>
        <li>how does the mirror add a profile for a new user, including
          their preferred language</li>
        <li>how does the mirror introduce itself when its first turned
          on<br>
        </li>
        <li>if the mirror needs to connect to the internet, how are
          those settings set<br>
        </li>
        <li>what if there is a person the mirror doesn't recognize (a
          guest who isn't going to be here long) how should the mirror
          react?</li>
        <li>would the mirror show you different things in the morning
          and in the evening?<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      There will be several different ways to accomplish this, so one
      major feature of the sketch phase is to create and evaluate
      multiple designs. Each of the members of your group should design
      a version of the interface on their own independently and then
      bring these designs together in a meeting and create your final
      proposed design. All of the original designs should be <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">significantly</span>
      different from each other. If each design is done by a different
      person then that will probably happen naturally. Each design
      should be composed of sketches showing how a user would accomplish
      a certain task with text explaining what this screen shows. You
      should be drawing lots of quick sketches at first to get your
      ideas out, then a period of refinement. In the end I would expect
      there to be at least 20 final pages per design. I would prefer
      that the designs that you turn in are done on a computer, but if
      you draw _neatly_ with a ruler and print very cleanly then that is
      also acceptable. Anything that looks like it was hastily drawn and
      ripped out of a spiral notebook and scanned 5 minutes before class
      will not be accepted.<br>
      <br>
      Your sketches should also take into account the constraints the
      system needs to work under. It should use current-level
      technology, and be something that could replace a bathroom mirror
      in a regular person's house / apartment without major remodeling.
      The physical mirror size is 4 feet wide by 3 feet tall. The
      maximum resolution of the display is 1280 x 720 pixels. You can
      assume the mirror does not fog up.<br>
      <br>
      You should come up with a cool name for your device ... Myrror ...
      refleXion ...<br>
      <br>
      Your interface should support multiple languages. It should allow
      the user to choose from at least 10 languages, but you only need
      to implement English and one other language. That second language
      could be a real language (see what languages your group members
      can write and speak) but Swedish chef or Klingon are acceptable as
      the second language if your team does not have a member that is
      fluent in another language, and there are automatic translators
      for those available on line. If your mirror talks then it should
      talk in at least two languages.<br>
      <br>
      It would also be a good idea to test your designs out on your
      friends, parents, or other novice computer users to see if it
      actually 'works.' Print out interface elements and tape them to
      your mirror in the morning. Time how long you spend in the
      bathroom. Having first time users talk aloud about what they are
      thinking when confronted with your interface can be extremely
      helpful in giving your assumptions a reality check.<br>
      <br>
      In the sketch phase your group should create a <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">well organized</span> public
      web page that contains the following:<br>
    </div>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">
      <li>scans or screen snapshots of the 20+ pages (each) that
        describe each of your group members' designs</li>
      <li>scans or screen snapshots of the 20+ pages that describe your
        final proposed design</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Important note: I will not be
      commenting on your sketches. I am not going to tell you what is
      good or bad about your design - that is where the value of having
      many voices on a team comes into play. Your grade will be based on
      the completeness of your information and the quality and variety
      of your designs.<br>
      <br>
      This project has two critique phases. An important part of user
      interface design is getting feedback. Part of this feedback comes
      in the design phase where the members of your group critique each
      others design and then come up with a final proposed design to
      implement. Part comes from presenting your final design to the
      other groups. Each project team will give a short 15 minute
      presentation on their final proposed design, and the reasons why
      it looks the way it does, to the rest of the class, and then
      answer questions from the class for another 15 minutes. Each
      person in the group must speak for part of that time. Groups will
      be graded on the quality of the presentation and the quality of
      the Q/A session, so I highly recommend practicing the presentation
      several times. Really. Practice it. Several times. Really. And you
      should focus your talk only on the final proposed group design.<br>
      <br>
      Members of the audience get points for asking good questions or
      making good comments about the interface presented. Each group can
      ask at most one question or comment per presentation for credit.
      When asking a question or making a comment the group member should
      identify their group by name - this is like in a press conference
      when the reporter says what paper he/she works for.<br>
      <br>
      Two groups will present each day for four days. The goal here,
      again, is to see different possible design alternatives and to get
      new ideas to improve your own design and implementation. As such
      the goal of the question and answer session is not to pick on
      people and rip their design apart, but rather to give constructive
      criticism on how to improve the design before people start
      implementation. The goal is for everyone to come up with a really
      good interface for the given problem.<br>
      <br>
      by 3/16 at 9pm I would like each group to add <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">another</span> design to
      their web page. This is the design that you plan to implement -
      including revisions based on the comments from the class. This may
      be a minor revision to your final proposed design if it went over
      well in class and you didn't see features in other designs that
      you want to add, or it might be a major revision if the class
      presentations gave you a lot of new things to think about. You can
      not make any major changes to the design after this point. That is
      the design you will be implementing.<br>

    <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;
        text-decoration: underline;">Implementation phase</span> <br>
      <br>
      Touch interfaces need to be implemented. If you want to use camera
      recognition then you can assume you have a camera that can
      recognize someone with training (but you need write the interface
      to 'train' the recognition). If you want voice recognition you
      need to implement it yourself on top of an existing library. You
      can use placeholders for health related data feeds and news and
      weather feeds, and music tracks, but the kinds and amount of data
      shown must be realistic, the display of the data should be
      helpful, and the methods of user interaction need to be
      implemented to show how the user will manipulate these various
      kinds of information. <br>
      <br>
      General grade scale:<br>
      - implementing the interface for the general information and
      health information with a good interface gets a C<br>
      - adding other useful features like those in the 'other things'
      section with a good interface gets a B<br>
      - having an elegant design for those features, or a very good
      design with some other useful features gets an A<br>
      <br>
      Your sketches from the first phase should allow you to divide up
      the work in the implementation phase, but I highly advise that the
      entire group hold regular meetings to look at the current state of
      the entire integrated interface. Trying to put components together
      at the last minute is a really bad idea. They rarely mesh
      programatically or visually. <br>
      <br>
      In this phase you should add to your web page:<br>
    </div>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">
      <li>a downloadable version of the interface written in qml along
        with any other necessary pieces of software (databases, etc)<br>
      </li>
      <li>a web page describing the important features of your
        application, who did what, and links to the source code and
        other data files. The web pages should include a series of
        screen shots, highlighting all of the features of your
        interface, with descriptive text, and a 2-3 minute YouTube video
        with narration showing your interface in action.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Any code,
        images, or other elements borrowed from others must be cited
        clearly in the interface itself and in the documentation.</span><br
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As with the
        sketch phase, this phase will also have a public critique of
        your completed project with the same rules as the sketch phase.
        We will connect a laptop from the team to the wall and show your
        interface in roughly life-size. While our touch-screen wall
        won't let you directly interact with your application you will
        be able to give a pretty realistic demonstration of how it would
        work.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You should
          also take advantage of sites such as
          http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/ to make sure that your
          interface will work for colour blind people.<br>

          By the end of the first week the project is out your group
          should set up a public web page, then email the location to
          andy, where each member posts weekly progress reports on what
          they have done that week. This shows how the various tasks
          were broken up, and who was getting things done. At the end of
          the project each project team member will give a rating for
          your co-workers which will be taken into account at grading
          time, and the weekly progress reports are good evidence for
          those ratings.<br>
