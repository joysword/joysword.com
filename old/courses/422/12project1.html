      interface and get used to qml before we break into groups and
      proceed onto Project 2.</p>
    <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> There are quite a few vending
      machines on campus serving a variety of 'edible' products. Right
      now these tend to rely on putting money in slots but in the future
      we will be able to communicate with these devices through our
      phones or pads. In this project you will create a pad interface
      for interacting with vending machines, allowing the user to see
      what items are available, more information on those items, and
      then select an item, pay for it, and pick it up. <br>
      <br>
      As an example we can think about the vending machine area on the
      second floor of SEL near the CS department's computer labs.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 800px; height: 600px;" src="GIFs/vend.JPG"
        alt=""><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;As the user approaches this area (note there are machines on
      3 sides), the vending machines would communicate with the user's
      tablet and update their current list of available items and
      prices. <br>
      <ul>
        <li>The user will be able to browse the available items and get
          additional information on a particular item including an image
          of the item, the price of the item, the ingredients, and
          nutritional information about that item.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The user should be able to browse categories of items
          (coffee, chips, gum, etc) to see what is available in that
          category if they don't know exactly what they want. </li>
        <li>The items should be independent of the machines they are
          sold from - i.e. your application should give the user an
          aggregate view of what is in the machines in a given area, not
          a per-machine view.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Once the user finds what he/she wants he/she should be able
          to buy it and have it appear in the vending machine's
          dispenser, so the app will need some way to store and update
          simulated credit card information. </li>
        <li>When the user buys an item the app should direct them to the
          correct machine, since multiple machines may have the same
          item. </li>
        <li>The app should remember the user's favorite things to make
          it easy to buy another of those quickly. This may also depend
          on the time of year.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The user should keep track of important personal preferences
          like ingredients the user is allergic to and must avoid
          (peanuts, milk, etc) and things they would prefer to avoid
          (gluten, etc) and then give a warning if the user is going to
          buy something dangerous or inappropriate.<br>
        </li>
        <li>There should be a button to complain if you don't get what
          you asked for.</li>
        <li>Your interface should also support multiple languages. It
          should allow the user to choose from at least 10 languages,
          but you only need to implement English and one other language.
          That second language could be a real language but Swedish chef
          or Klingon are acceptable as the second language, and there
          are automatic translators for those available on line. </li>
        <li>Your app should also support multiple currencies since we
          may have some people from out of town visiting the university
          and they would like to know what the price is in a currency
          they are familiar with.</li>
        <li>Your application should have some information on who made it
          and will very likely want to include some instructions.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      To make things realistic, your application should be able to
      handle all of the different items in the 2nd floor SEL vending
      machines, but you only need to give full details (photo, price,
      nutritional information) on 20 of them, with all the various
      categories of items represented. The others should be named but
      could have placeholder images, prices, ingredients, and
      nutritional information. You may want to break up the work of
      finding all this information across the class and use the piazza
      pages to distribute it.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Your project should be able
        to run in the qml viewer application on windows / mac / linux.
        It does not need to run on an actual pad, but the interface
        should support the kind of interaction you would expect on a
        pad. It does not need to connect to an external database with
        information on the various food items, it could read that
        information from a local file, but if you implement an external
        web/cloud-based database it would be a bonus.</span><br>

      <b>Implementing Project 1<br>
      </b><br>
      You should start by taking a look at what is available in the
      vending machines by the CS computer labs (eg coffee, pop,
      munchies, etc.) and very likely taking some photos of the
      available products and prices so you can simulate them later, and
      then start drawing some sketches for how to lay out that
      information given the screen size and resolution.<br>
      <br>
      For this assignment everyone will use QML (qt.nokia.com/qtquick/)
      so there is a common platform. Take a look at the QML examples for
      some ideas on the kinds of layouts and interactions that it was
      designed to develop.<br>
      <br>
      We will assume a display size of 7.75 inches x 5.75 inches at 1024
      x 768 pixels (ie roughly iPad specs) and you should use landscape
      orientation by default for your interface.<br>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">Each person will work individually on this project.
        This project is NOT a team project.</p>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </div>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">It is expected that all of the code used in these
        programs will be written by you. You can use code from the web
        as examples and a guide to writing your code, but the code you
        turn in for the project must be your own. <br>
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </div>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">Any code, images, icons, or other elements borrowed
        from others <u>must</u> be fully cited in your application
        itself, in the README file along with your source code, and on
        your webpages<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">If you
          implement all of the functionality above with a serviceable
          user interface then you get a C. The B and A grades depend on
          the quality of the user interface that you create.</span><br>
      </p>
      <hr style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;">
      <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Turning in Project 1</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">You should create a set of public
        (available to anyone) web pages that describe your work on the
        project. This should include:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 page containing a link to a gzipped file containing the
          well-commented source code and all other necessary files to
          make your application run locally. This page should include
          instructions on how to install and run your app starting from
          "I have a web browser on my computer." You should provide
          links and clear instructions on everything needed to get your
          application running. </li>
        <li>1 page on how to use your application and the things you can
          do with it.</li>
        <li>1 page on why you think you have cteated a good interface.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: left;">all of which should have plenty of
        screenshots with meaningful captions. Web pages like this can be
        very helpful later on in helping you build up a portfolio of
        your work when you start looking for a job so please put some
        effort into it.<br>
        <br>
        You should also create a 2-3 minute YouTube video showing the
        use of your application including narration with decent audio
        quality. That video should be in a very obvious place on your
        main project web page. The easiest way to do this is to use a
        screen-capture tool while interacting with the application,
        though you will most likely find its useful to do some editing
        afterwards to tighten the video up. Its also a good idea to have
        a video like this available as a backup during your presentation
        just in case of gremlins.<br>
        <br>
        The web page including screen snapshots and video need to be
        done by the deadline so be sure to leave enough time to get that
        work done. Once you have your webpage done, send the URL to the
        TA before the deadline.<br>
        <br>
        I will be linking your web page to the course notes so please
        send me a nice representative 1024 x 768 jpg image of your
        application for the web. This should be named
        p1.&lt;your_last_name&gt;.&lt;your_first_name&gt;.jpg.&nbsp; <br>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Presenting Project 1</b></p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">An important part of creating user
        interfaces is getting feedback and using it to improve your
        design. Given the class size, this can be a bit of a challenge.
        On 2/7 and 2/9, after the project has been turned in, we will
        have some group discussions and presentations about the
        solutions to Project 1.</p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">On Tuesday 2/7 the class will
        break into groups. Each group will compare notes on their
        solutions to the problem and come to an agreement on a single
        revised interface design, so bring printed screenshots of your
        design to this class meeting (the web pages you created to turn
        in the assignment should be able to do double-duty here.) This
        revised design does not have to be implemented; it should be
        presented as a series of screen snapshots/mockups for the major
        functions.</p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Before Thursday's class on 2/9
        each group should create a web page with the team members'
        names, the screen snapshots for the revised design, and a
        description of how the revised interface will be used. The
        address of this page should be emailed to the TA before class
        begins on Thursday.</p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">On Thursday 2/9 each of the groups
        will give a presentation on the revised interface that
        their&nbsp;group came up with, using their web page, showing the
        snapshots and giving a brief description of its functionality.
        The length of the presentation will be determined once we know
        the number of groups, but most likely around 5 minutes.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Very likely later on in the term
        the class will break into different groups and revise the
        revised designs again.<br>
      </p>
