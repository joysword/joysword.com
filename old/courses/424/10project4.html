This will be the third group project. This project is going to make use
of a larger base dataset (at over 50 gig) and supplement it with a
dynamic real-time data stream. The data will consist of tweets. This
project will focus more on the data
processing side - how do you find meaning in the wide variety of
tweets, and condense a large source dataset into something that can be
used in an interactive visual analytics tool. <br>
<br>
This project will be more open-ended than the previous three giving
each group more options in how you want to try to find meaning in this
data.<br>

The twitter7 dataset at stanford http://snap.stanford.edu/data/#twitter
contains 475 million tweets from 17 million users from June through
December 2009. Its broken up into seven files where each file is 1-3
gig of compressed text and up to 8 gigs when uncompressed. At 26
gigabytes the complete dataset starts to give you an idea of the kind
of datasets that are common today. <br>
<br>
The files are composed of lines like the following:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2009-12-01
00:00:31</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

I
wonder
how
often
you think of me, if ever. Today is not a happy day.</span><br>
<br>
</div>
<div
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">This
gives
you
the
date
and time of the tweet, the sender, and the tweet
itself (which are mostly in English, but also in a variety of other
languages and character sets). As you can see there are some easy ways
to compress the data down, even in text ual form.<br>
<br>
There are
lots of people talking about lots of different things using twitter so
there is a lot of background noise and the popularity of different
topics can change rapidly. You should use this seven months of data to
better understand the signal to noise ratio in twitter - what were the
most common topics, and how did they relate to events in the news? How
did the number of tweets vary with time of day or day of the year? Can
you categorize users by how often they tweet? Can you link @usernames
and #hashtags into networks? <br>
<br>
Here is one starting point:
http://blog.twitter.com/2009/12/top-twitter-trends-of-2009.html<br>
<br>
The first part of the project is to organize that data into a browsable
form and give the user a visual overview of this seven months of data
from different perspectives, and let the user interact to investigate
the data in further detail.<br>
<br>
Given your experience with that dataset, the second part of the project
will investigate at the stream of tweets flying by. The static dataset
from 2009 only gives the time, user, and content of the tweet, but we
can filter the dynamic stream in more ways.<br>
<br>
One
of
the
libraries
available for processing is tweet stream which lets
you receive tweets based on location, or keywords, or sender. Given the
large number of tweets being sent, you
won't
be able to deal with the entire data set but will only be able to look
at a small sample of the stream. Filtering by keywords or locations
allows you to focus on the tweets you are more likely to be interested
in. In part two you are going to look at what people are talking about
in different locations. We will look at tweets
from New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, or if you want a wider variety
you could try London, Toronto, and Chicago. Sticking with predominantly
English-speaking cities makes it easier to compare topics across
different cities.<br>
<br>
As with part one you should also investigate changes related to the
time of day and day of
the week, and see how the topics&nbsp; in the dynamic stream relate to
events in the news. In part 2 you should collect data on tweets coming
from each of the three locations for at least a week. This way you have
the general background knowledge from last year, current knowledge from
the previous week, and be able to use that to help classify and compare
the data currently flowing by. <br>
<br>
The visualizations and interfaces for Part 1 and 2 should be well
integrated<br>
<br>
trendingtopics is a good place to look for topics which are currently
gaining in popularity.<br>
<br>
http://tweetstats.com/ is also a nice place to
look for some initial data and there is a list of other possible
starting points at

to interact with and investigate the dynamic dataset from Part 2 to
compare the tweets from the three chosen cities, and relate them to the

As with projects 2 and 3, each Friday each member of the team should
post a
description of what they did on the project to the project web site.<br>
<br>
This time your group should also produce a 2 minute youtube video
showing off the capabilities of your tool. The easiest way to do this
is to use a screen-capture tool while interacting with the
application, though you will most likely find its useful to do some
editing afterwards to tighten the video up. Its also a good idea to
have a video like this available as a backup during your presentation.<br>

sure that your application is Mac / Windows / Linux compatible. If you
can get your app to run online through a browser then do include that

they did what was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then
give them a 3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a
particular reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine

<br>
Since
we have six groups to go through in 75 minutes, each group will talk
for 8 minutes plus 4 minutes for questions from the other groups. The
presentation time should be evenly split among all members of the
group. Each group sitting in the audience will be allowed one question
for the group currently presenting, so come up with a good one. In
answering the questions the group presenting should be concise so all
of the other groups have a chance to ask questions.</span><br
