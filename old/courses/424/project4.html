      This will be the third group project. This project is going to
      focus more on finding patterns in unstructured data and presenting
      information effectively.<br>
      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
        Group size this time will be <font color="#ffff00">3 or 4
          people per group</font>. You can chose who you want to be in a
        group with, but you will be working with different people in
        each project.<br>
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <br>
          As with Projects 2 and 3 you should very quickly set up a web
          page for your group project and send the URL to Andy and
          Arthur. Each Friday of the project each team member should
          post on the project web site an overview of what he/she did on
          the project that week.</span></font><br>

      Each year for Viz Week there are a variety of challenges posted to
      see which groups around the world can most effectively use
      visualization to solve problems. We are going to look at the 120
      MB dataset from the 2011 mini challenge 1 - Geospatial and
      Microblogging - Characterization of an Epidemic Spread,&nbsp;
      which is mostly time-stamped and location-stamped text messages
      from a one month period.<br>
      <br>
      the data is available at <a
        href="http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast11/">http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast11/</a><br>
      <br>
      The solution to this mystery is available, so finding the solution
      is not the object here. The goal here is to create a tool using
      the touch-screen wall to easily and effectively sift through and
      investigate the data, and show that the given solution is the best
      match for the data and that the other possible causes are less
      likely. People are getting sick. Is it an accident or a criminal /
      terrorist act? Is it a truck crash, or a plane crash, or a gas
      line explosion or a bomb or just a normal flu outbreak?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Your tool should allow the user to:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>search for 'interesting' words and sets of words in
          messages, dealing with synonyms and misspellings and acronyms</li>
        <li>graphically show changes in patterns of the words / messages
          before and after the incidents in terms of topic or location
          or time of day, day of week, etc</li>
        <li>see the locations of a given message or set of messages with
          particular keywords on the map<br>
        </li>
        <li>find people that got sick and track them over time through
          their conversations and on the map</li>
        <li>allow the user to pan and zoom the map while the data
          updates<br>
        </li>
        <li>add interesting people, words, events in town, etc to
          dynamic lists in the app that can be saved and accessed again
          later to bring back previous content on the screen</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a
        C you need to</span><br>
      <br>
      Create the tool described above to let people easily and
      effectively visualize this dataset. <br>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a
        B you need to</span><br>
      <br>
      Document why the given solution is the solution, using your tool.
      Your tool should make this obvious. This very likely will mean
      that you will need to enhance or modify your tool. <br>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For
        an A you need to </span><br>
      <br>
      Investigate and document the various possible causes for the
      epidemic and detail, using your tool, why they are or are not
      likely solutions. Your tool should make this obvious. This will
      involve doing comparisons / contrasts between different possible
      solutions. This very likely will mean that you will need to
      enhance or modify your tool.

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:

          pages that describe your work on the project. This should
          include:</span><br>
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span>
      </div>
      <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:

        <li>1 page on how to use your application and the things you can
          do with it. </li>
        <li>1 page on the data you used including where you got it, what
          you did to it.<br>
        </li>
        <li>1 page with links to the source code and any instructions
          necessary to install and run it. These instructions should
          start from the assumption that the reader has a web browser on
          their computer and tell the user everything else he/she needs
          to know to get the code and get it running.<br>
        </li>
        <li><font color="#ffff00">several pages on what interesting
            things you found using your application.</font></li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">all of
        which should have plenty of screenshots with meaningful
        captions. </span><span style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Web pages like this can be very
        helpful later on in helping you build up a portfolio of your
        work when you start looking for a job so please put some effort
        into it.</span><br>
      <br>
      Be sure to document any external libraries or tools that you make
      use of - give credit where credit is due.<br style="font-family:

        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> You
          should also create a 2-3 minute YouTube video showing the use
          of your application including narration with decent audio
          quality. That video should be in a very obvious place on your
          main project web page. The easiest way to do this is to use a
          screen-capture tool while interacting with a scaled-down
          version of the application, though you will most likely find
          its useful to do some editing afterwards to tighten the video
          up. Its also a good idea to have a video like this available
          as a backup during your presentation just in case of gremlins.</span></font>
      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You may want to shoot
        this video on the wall itself.</font><br style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The web
        page including screen snapshots and video need to be done by the
        deadline so be sure to leave enough time to get that work done.</span>
      For this project the web page will be particularly important.<br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> I will be
        linking your web page to the course notes so please send me a
        nice 1280 x 361 jpg image of your visualization for the web.
        This should be named
        p4.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg.&nbsp; </span><br
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <br>
      When the project is done, each person in the group should also
      send me a private email ranking your coworkers on the project on a
      scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in terms of how good a coworker
      they were on the project. If you never want to work with them
      again, give them a 1. If this person would be a first choice for a
      partner on a future project then give them a 5. If they did what
      was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then give them a
      3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a particular
      reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine your
      responses to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will
      average out all these scores for projects 2 through 4 and keep
      them in mind when assigning final grades to projects 2 through 4.<br>
