      We are going to spend the last two lectures of the class looking
      at visualizations that you think are particularly interesting.<br>
      <br>
      First you should find an interactive visualization that you think
      is well done and interesting.<br>
    </span><br>
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> One place to start looking might
        be at manyeyes: <a
          href="http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations">http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations</a><br>
        or FlowingdData <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">http://flowingdata.com/</a>
        or gizmodo has an <a
          href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/infographics/">infographics tag</a>
        .<br>
        <br>
        You should try and pick something that has not been presented in
        the class before, or if the concept has been presented before it
        should be presented in a new way or from a different
        perspective. Choosing a visualization from the last year
        increases your odds of it being new.<br>
        <br>
        Visualizations and data sources related to other countries would
        be much appreciated as those would give me a wider variety of
        visualizations to show future classes.<br>
        <br>
        Once you have chosen a visualization email Andy with its
        location so it can be approved and we ensure that everyone is
        doing something different.<br>
        <br>
        You should create a web page with a link to the original
        visualization and your discussion about the good features of the
        interactive visualization, and things that could be better about
        the visualization. Based on what we have talked about in class
        and what you have experienced in creating these kinds of
        applications, apply that knowledge to critique this
        visualization. </span><span style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This should be a critical
          discussion of the value of the visualization: what is the
          data? how was it collected? what works and what needs
          improvement? what questions do people want to ask? how can
          they find the answers with this tool? <br>
          <br>
          Once you have your web page done, email its location to Andy
          and include a screen snapshot so we can link all the pages
          into the class webpages.<br>
          <br>
        </span></span><span style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Each person will have <font
            color="#ffff00">4 minutes</font> to present the
          visualization and their critique.<br>
          <br>
          We will again have the audience fill out comment cards that
          are given directly to you so you can see if your presentation
          skills have improved since the beginning of the term and where
          you may still need to focus.<br>
