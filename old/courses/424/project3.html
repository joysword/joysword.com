        We will again have 3 people per group. You can chose who you

          As with Project 2 you should very quickly set up a web page
          for your new group project and send the URL to andy. Each
          Friday of the project each team member should post on the
          project web site an overview of what he/she did on the project
          that week.</span></font><br style="font-family:

      In this project we are going to take a look at data related to
      highway deaths from the National Highway Traffic Safety
      Administration, and in particular their Fatality Analysis
      Reporting System at http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx<br>
      <br>
      There is a great deal of data available on the Query FARS Data
      tab.<font color="#ffff00"> Data is available from 1994 through
        2010. We will be using the data starting in 2001 when latitude
        and longitude values appear. </font><br>
      <br>
      The goal of the project is to produce an application that lest the
      user easily investigate this dataset to look for patterns, trends,
      and interesting features. What are the most important factors that
      affect highway fatalities? Are things getting better or worse and
      why? Where are the most dangerous places, driving conditions,
      driver impairments?<br>
      <br>
      The project will involve both graphs and maps as the major
      visualization elements. Graphs will be good for showing the
      numeric data and breakdowns of that data into categories (type of
      vehicle, pedestrians / drivers / occupants, age, sex) as well as
      looking at that data raw or per population, miles traveled, type
      of roadway, whether alcohol was involved, etc, and organized by
      year, month, time of day, weather. You should also be able to
      graph the data by state but it will be important to correct for
      population differences. Maps will be useful to mark the specific
      locations of these incidents.<br>
      <br>
      We will be focusing on Illinois and how the Illinois data compares
      to the national data.<br>
      <br>
      You will want to condense some of the data types (e.g. car body
      type) and convert many of the numeric categories (e.g. car body
      type, atmospheric conditions) into English names in the interface.

        </li>
        <li>be able to cluster the data on the map and graph (i.e. if I

      There are various map libraries available for processing. Modest
      Maps seems like the best choice for the project.<br>
      Unfolding maps (http://unfoldingmaps.org) is another popular map
      library but doesn't seem stable with the current 2.0 beta versions
      of processing.<br>

        <li>1 page with links to the source code and any instructions

          to know to get the code and get it running.<br>
        </li>

        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> You
          should also create a 2-3 minute YouTube video showing the use
          of your application including narration with decent audio
          quality. That video should be in a very obvious place on your
          main project web page. The easiest way to do this is to use a
          screen-capture tool while interacting with a scaled-down
          version of the application, though you will most likely find
          its useful to do some editing afterwards to tighten the video
          up. Its also a good idea to have a video like this available
          as a backup during your presentation just in case of gremlins.</span></font>

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The web

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> I will be
        linking your web page to the course notes so please send me a

      <br>
      When the project is done, each person in the group should also
      send me a private email ranking your coworkers on the project on a
      scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in terms of how good a coworker
      they were on the project. If you never want to work with them
      again, give them a 1. If this person would be a first choice for a
      partner on a future project then give them a 5. If they did what
      was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then give them a
      3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a particular
      reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine your
      responses to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will
      average out all these scores for projects 2 through 4 and keep
      them in mind when assigning final grades to projects 2 through 4.<br>

        During each talk each group in the audience should write one
        good question for the speaking group, and hand it to them at the
        end of their presentation. The speaking group should add a page
        to their website by Thursday 11/08 giving the questions (and the
        group who asked it) and an answer to the question.</font><br>
