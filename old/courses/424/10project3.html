In this project we will make use of the internet movie database
(www.imdb.com) to investigate movie genres over time.<br>
<br>
The raw data is available at http://www.imdb.com/interfaces#plain<br>
<br>
The genres.list file contains information on the genre(s) of the films
in the database.<br>
<br>
We will use a subset of the main genres: Action, Adventure, Animation,
Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Fantasy, Family, Film-Noir, Horror,
Musical, Mystery, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller, War, Western<br>
<br>
We will ignore some of the genres such as Adult, Short, Sport,
Biography, History, Reality-TV, Talk-Show, News, Game-Show. </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">You can go through the genres list
and remove any line with any of these ignored genres. If the film also
has a genre or genres other than the ignored ones then it will remain
in the sample for the project, unless it is 'Adult' or 'Short'. </span></span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">If 'Adult' or 'Short' are listed as a
genre however, all entries for that film should be removed. Do be
careful not to remove other films with the same name that came out in a
different year.</span></span> <br>

So <br>
100 Most Shocking Music Moments (2009) (TV)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reality-TV<br>
would get removed from the project because its only Reality-TV ( and
would also get removed as shown below because its TV)<br>
<br>
but<br>
Tin Cup (1996)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romance<br>
Tin Cup (1996)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sport<br>
would still exist in the project because even though the Sport genre is
removed it still has Comedy, Drama, and Romance.<br>
<br>
however<br>
Hardware Wars (1978)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sci-Fi<br>
Hardware Wars (1978)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Short<br>
would be completely removed since one of its genres is Short.<br>
<br>
</span><br>
<br>
We will also ignore any direct-to-video releases (V), video games (VG),
TV movies (TV), and TV episodes {Title (#episode #)}</span><br>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
Some films also have more than one genre eg:<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adventure<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drama<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mystery<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romance<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thriller<br>
<br>
<br>
The release-dates.list file gives more detailed release date
information eg:<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USA:17 July
1959&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Los Angeles, California)<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USA:28 July
1959&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (Chicago, Illinois)<br>
North by Northwest (1959)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USA:6 August
1959&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (New York City, New York)<br>
<br>
Up through the 70s it was common for films in the US to be released in
different cities in different weeks and months. In this file we will be
interested in the earliest USA release date.
Some will have only years, others month and day.<br>
<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The ratings file
gives the distribution of quality ratings that people
have given each film both as an aggregate number and a distribution eg:</span><br>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></div>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">We will also limit
the films to those that have already been released
as the database includes films that have been announced or are already
in production. We will start with films released in 1920, since most
early films would be considered short films today.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><br>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As with the
earlier projects you should first get a copy of the data
files and take a look at them to try and understand their structure.
Then you need to decide how you want to integrate these various files
together into a form that you can visualize. This may involve writing
shell scripts or programs to process the files, or loading the
information into a database. </span><br>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></div>

</span>
<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a C
you need ...</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>be able to pick a genre (eg Drama) from the list given above and
shown on the user interface and
see a distribution of films in that genre on a well-labeled timeline
showing each
year from 1920 through 2010. <br>
  </li>
  <li>the user should be able to display the distribution of a genre in
several ways - in terms of absolute numbers or&nbsp; percentage for
that year, or how this year compares to the average for this genre over
the entire time, since the number of films made per year is highly
variable.</li>
  <li>the user should be able to choose a year and see the distribution
of all genres for that year<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">you should
check your visualization with a colour blindness tool to
see that its ok</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">everything
should update quickly as you interact</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a B
you need to add ...</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
<br>
</span>
<ul>
  <li>the user should be able to pick more than one genre and see their
results simultaneously for comparison purposes</li>
  <li>selecting a genre should bring up a listing of the top films in
that genre across the entire data set both in terms of the highest
rated films and the most popular (which we will use the number of votes
for). Note that for top rated films you will need to set a minimum
number of votes and that minimum may not be the same across all years
of the database.<br>
  </li>
  <li>clicking on a particular year for a genre should show the top 5
films in that genre for that year both in terms of the highest rated
films and the most popular</li>
  <li>when choosing a particular year to look at the overall genre
distribution, the user should be able to see the top film in each genre
for that year.<br>
  </li>
  <li>the user should be able to cluster the results by decade and see
the aggregate results for that decade (eg now you would see the top
films in the decade not just the year, how this decade compares to
others, etc)</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For an A
you need to add ...</span>
<ul>
  <li>the user should be able to pick any number of genres and see
their results simultaneously to compare the popularity of different
genres over time<br>
  </li>
  <li>the user should be able to investigate whether different genres
are more commonly released in different times of the year either by
seasons or by months and see if this distribution changes over the
decades. Here you should only use the films that have information on
their month of release in the USA</li>
  <li>the user should be able to choose combinations of genres to see
the popularity of films that are in multiple genres <br>
  </li>
  <li>be able to scale the timeline to focus in on different periods in
more detail<br>
  </li>
</ul>

As with project 2, each Friday each member of the team should post a
description of what they did on the project to the project web site.
There are more opportunities in this project for different team members
to focus on different areas.<br>

<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As
with
Project
1
and
2
you
should
create
a
web
page
describing your work on the
application. TIf possible make an embedded applet of your application
but the data files may be large so be sure to have a link so people can
download your application
(and the necessary data files) to run your application. Please make
sure that your application is Mac / Windows / Linux compatible. If you
can get your app to run online through a browser then do include that
version as well. The web page should describe the contribution of each
team member (ie who worked on which interface elements, who worked on
converting the data into a more usable form, etc.)<br>
<br>
Please send me a 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for the
web. This
should be named p2.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg. <br>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Each person in
the group should also send me a private email ranking
your coworkers on the project on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in
terms of how good a coworker they were on the project. If you never
want to work with them again, give them a 1. If this person would be a
first choice for a partner on a future project then give them a 5. If
they did what was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then
give them a 3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a
particular reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine
your responses to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will
average out all these scores for projects 2 through 4 and keep them in
mind when
assigning
final grades.</span><br>
<br>
Each group
will present their work to the class and describe
its features to the rest of the
class. This allows everyone to see a variety of solutions to the
problem, and a variety of implementations.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Since
we have six groups to go through in 75 minutes, each group will talk
for 8 minutes plus 4 minutes for questions from the other groups. The
presentation time should be evenly split among all members of the
group. Each group sitting in the audience will be allowed one question
for the group currently presenting, so come up with a good one. In
answering the questions the group presenting should be concise so all
of the other groups have a chance to ask questions.</span><br
