    <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Project 2 will be the first group
      project and will focus on converting data into a form for
      visualization using processing on the touchscreen wall in the
      classroom.<br>
      <br>
      Group size will be 3 people per group. You can chose who you want
      to be in a group with, but you will be working with different
      people in each project. I will create groups for people that do
      not form groups on their own by Friday.<br>
      <br>
      You should very quickly set up a web page for your group project
      and send the URL to andy along with the names of the members of
      your group. The final webpage for the project will be public; the
      in-process web pages do not need to be public as long as Andy and
      Arthur have access. Each Friday of the project each team member
      should post on the project web site an overview of what he/she did
      on the project that week. This comes in handy when assigning
      ratings to your collaborators and making sure that everyone is
      contributing.<br>
      <br>
      Note that the due date for project 2 is on a Wednesday, rather
      than the normal Monday. The classroom (and its wall) will be
      reconfigured as demo space for a conference the week of 10/9 and
      10/11, and will not be available for testing. <br>

    <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In this project we are going to
      investigate the popularity of different kinds of monsters over the
      years in movies.<br>
      <br>
      We will make use of the internet movie database (www.imdb.com).
      The raw data is available at http://www.imdb.com/interfaces#plain<br>
      <br>
      The keywords that people have applied to various films will let
      you see which films involve vampires, werewolves, aliens, robots,
      giant monsters, witches, zombies (voodoo kind), zombies (ghoul
      kind), Dr. Frankenstein's monster, sea monster / lake monster,
      giant insects, mutants, demons, monster plants, Bigfoot /
      Sasquatch / yeti, ghosts, and the various subcategories of each.
      You are encouraged to add other categories here, and you should
      look at the variations in each of the keywords to make sure you
      are getting the most accurate data.<br>
      <br>
      The application should help the user investigate various things,
      e.g.<br>
      <ul>
        <li> what is the relative popularity of a particular monster
          type over the years?</li>
        <li> are the number of monster films generally stable or does
          the number ebb and flow in a pattern?</li>
        <li>how common are different monsters in the films made in
          different countries?</li>
        <li> which monsters tend to hang out with which other types of
          monsters?</li>
        <li> does the success of a popular film with a particular type
          of monster inspire a glut of films with the same kind of
          monster in the following years?</li>
        <li> are there particular world events that trigger interest in
          particular kinds of monsters (e.g. the atomic bomb, first
          satellite / man in space / man on moon, the environmental
          movement, computers, nano-technology, etc)? </li>
      </ul>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      Much of your work will involve the keyword information but you
      will also need other information such as genres, rating, business,
      country of origin, and certificates.<br>
      <br>
      We will not include any video games (VG) or TV episodes or any
      films that have 'Adult' or 'Documentary' as a genre, but TV movies
      (TV) and direct to video releases (V) should be included in the
      visualization. <br>
      <br>
      You should first download a copy of the various data files and
      take a look at them to try and understand their structure. Then
      you need to decide how you want to integrate these various files
      together into a form that you can visualize. This may involve
      writing shell scripts or programs to process the files, or loading
      the information into a database you can access via processing.
      Note that there are a lot of TV episodes in the IMDB so I would
      suggest filtering those out of your database / files ASAP. If you
      do choose to use a database make sure that it will work on the
      computer driving the classroom wall.<br>
      <br>
      We will deal with films from 1890 through 2012<br>
      <br>
      You should convert the budgets (available from the business data)
      to 2012 dollars by taking inflation, and currency conversion if
      necessary, into account so they can be compared more accurately.
      This will allow you to cluster the films into big budget, low
      budget, and no budget films, based on a criteria that you create.<br>
      <br>
      Data may not be available in all categories so you need an
      effective way of showing which information is missing. Missing
      data does not mean that you toss out the film; it means you find a
      way to show that particular pieces of information are missing
      (e.g. a film has an unknown genre or an unknown budget)<br>
      <br>
      The current US MPAA rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17) began
      in 1968 and has changed a few times since then (e.g. PG was
      originally M and then became GP before becoming PG, and NC-17 was
      formerly X). Some earlier films have been re-rated, but many are
      not rated, though they would be equivalent to G or PG. Wikipedia
      has a nice article with all the details.<br>
      <br>
      There will be two visualizations<br>
      <br>
      The main visualization will be a timeline. The timeline should be
      dynamic so the user can see all the data at once, or a subset of
      years in more detail, or cluster the data by decade. For each year
      the user should be able to see the total number of monster films,
      and how that compares to the total number of films for that year,
      or look at details for just the monster films that year. The data
      for each year can further be broken down and visualized by
      categories.<br>
      <br>
      You should come up with a good color coding scheme allowing the
      user to color the timeline graph by:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>type of monster (vampire, werewolf, ghost, etc)<br>
        </li>
        <li>country of origin (US, UK, Japan, France, etc)<br>
        </li>
        <li>genre (Horror, comedy, drama, musical)<br>
        </li>
        <li>budget level (high / low / no)</li>
        <li>format (movie, video, TV movie)<br>
        </li>
        <li>certificates (G / GP / PG / R, etc)</li>
        <li>quality ratings (ranges in the IMDB ratings)</li>
        <li>popularity (ranges in # votes)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      You should come up with an intuitive interface to let people
      filter the data by the above categories, and combinations of those
      categories e.g. I want to see only high budget vampire musicals
      from 1930 to 1960, or I want to see what genres are the most
      common in the 1970s for ghost stories, or I want to look at all
      the monster movies but colour code them into high-budget,
      low-budget, and no-budget films, or I want to compare the number
      of ghost stories to giant monsters over all the decades, allowing
      the user to show all the data or subsets of the data. <br>
      <br>
      The user should be able to select their options from menus of
      choices<br>
      <br>
      The user should be able to select a year or range of years and see
      a tabular version of the data in the timeline. The user should
      also be able to bring up data on the individual films.<br>
      <br>
      Note that a single film may have multiple monster keywords and/or
      multiple genres so you will need to decide, and defend your
      decision, how you will integrate that data with a film that has a
      single monster keyword and genre. Note that picking one keyword or
      one genre from the set is not a valid solution.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Aside from the timeline, another visualization will show the most
      common genres, countries of origin, budget level, certificates,
      quality level, and other keywords for a given monster or
      combination of monsters.<br>
      <font color="#ffff00"><br>
        There are various data processing steps necessary to get the
        data ready for visualization. You can do this processing in your
        main application, or with a separate application, or through
        scripts or database commands. You need to document this process,
        and to as great an extent as possible automate this process, so
        that it would be easy for a person to take the current version
        of the IMDB data and update the data that your program makes use
        of. <br>
        <br>
        Your program should be interactive and respond quickly when the
        user changes the data he/she is viewing. This means you may need
        to create a set of pre-processed data files that are designed to
        be visualized quickly, rather than running complex queries or
        matching algorithms each time the user touches a button. These
        are also things that should be documented.</font><br>

        </li>
        <li>1 page with links to the source code and any instructions
          necessary to instal l and run it. These instructions should
          start from the assumption that the reader has a web browser on
          their computer and tell the user everything else he/she needs
          to know to get the code and get it running.<br>
        </li>
        <li>1 page on what interesting things you found using your

        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">all of
        which should have plenty of screenshots with meaningful
        captions. </span><span style="font-family:

        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> You
          should also create a 2-3 minute YouTube video showing the use
          of your application including narration with decent audio
          quality. That video should be in a very obvious place on your
          main project web page. The easiest way to do this is to use a
          screen-capture tool while interacting with a scaled-down
          version of the application, though you will most likely find
          its useful to do some editing afterwards to tighten the video
          up. Its also a good idea to have a video like this available
          as a backup during your presentation just in case of gremlins.</span></font>

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The web

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> I will be
        linking your web page to the course notes so please send me a
        nice 1280 x 361 jpg image of your visualization for the web.

      </span><br>
      When the project is done, each person in the group should also
      send me a private email with no one else cc'd ranking your
      coworkers on the project on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in
      terms of how good a coworker they were on the project. If you
      never want to work with them again, give them a 1. If this person
      would be a first choice for a partner on a future project then
      give them a 5. If they did what was expected but nothing
      particularly good or bad then give them a 3. By default your score
      should be 3 unless you have a particular reason to increase or
      decrease the number. Please confine your responses to 1, 2, 3, 4,
      5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will average out all these scores
      for projects 2 through 4 and keep them in mind when assigning
      final grades to projects 2 through 4.<br>
