      This will be the third group project. This project is going to
      focus more on the data processing side and getting data into a
      manageable form to interact with and draw some conclusions. This
      project will be more open-ended than the previous three.<br>
      <br>
      In this project you will be able to form your own groups,
      preferably with three members.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As with
        Projects 2-3 you should also very quickly set up a web page for
        your group project and send the URL to andy. Each Friday of the
        project each team member should post on the project web site an
        overview of what he/she did on the project that week.</span><br>

      In this project we will take a look at some data from last.fm on
      their users and the music that they listen to.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The static files you will be using are located here:
      http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/index.html<br>
      and there is also the Last.fm api http://www.last.fm/api<br>

        <li>allow the user to compare top artists for several ages,

        <li>given an artist, show other artists the user is likely to

          user to refine the results. Allow the user to filter out
          common popular artists.<br>
        </li>
        <li>show the most popular times of day for people to play music,
          remember to correct for the local time, and show how those

      As with Projects 1-3&nbsp; you should create a set of web pages
      describing your work on the application. This time instead of
      embedding the processing application you should have a link so
      people can download your application (and the necessary data
      files) to run your application. Please make sure that your
      application is Mac / Windows / Linux compatible. If you can get
      your app to run online through a browser then do include that
      version as well. The web pages should also describe the
      contribution of each team member (ie who worked on which interface
      elements, who worked on converting the data into a more usable
      form, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      Please send me a 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for
      the web. This should be named
      p4.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg. <br>
      <br>
      When the project is done, each person in the group should also
      send me a private email ranking your coworkers on the project on a
      scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in terms of how good a coworker
      they were on the project. If you never want to work with them
      again, give them a 1. If this person would be a first choice for a
      partner on a future project then give them a 5. If they did what
      was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then give them a
      3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a particular
      reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine your
      responses to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will
      average out all these scores for projects 2 through 4 and keep
      them in mind when assigning final grades to projects 2 through 4.<br>
      <br>
      Each group will present their work to the class and describe its
      features to the rest of the class. All team members are expected
      to participate equally in that presentation. <span style="color:
        rgb(255, 255, 0);">Since there are 7 groups each talk will be 7
        minutes long. Note the extra time for this one. During each talk
        each group in the audience should write 1 question for the
        speaking group, and hand it to them at the end of their
        presentation. The speaking group should add a page to their
        website by Thursday 11/24 giving the questions (and the group
        who asked it) and an answer to the question.</span><br>
