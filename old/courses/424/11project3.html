        be the second group project and the focus here will be on
        geographic data and on integrating data from multiple sources
        with various levels of rigor in their data.<br>
        <br>
        As with Project 2 you should very quickly set up a web page for
        your group project and send the URL to andy. Each Friday of the
        project each team member should post on the project web site an
        overview of what he/she did on the project that week.</span><br

      In this project we are going to take a look at data on
      unidentified flying objects from the National UFO Reporting Center
      at www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxloc.html<br>
      <br>
      We will take the reported UFO sightings in the <span
        style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">contiguous</span> US from Jan
      2001 through December 2010, which will be about 35 MB of data, and
      correlate them with airport locations available at
      www.partow.net/miscellaneous/airportdatabase/ and population
      density available at factfinder2.census.gov. <span style="color:

      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a
        C you need ...</span><br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>plot the data geographically using different icons/colours
          for the different types of sightings. You will very likely
          want to come up with some higher level categories for the many
          different sighting types (cigar, changing, chevron, circle,
          cylinder, diiamond, disk, egg, fireball, flash, formation,
          light, other, oval, rectangle, sphere, teardrop, triangle,
          unknown, etc) to reduce the number of categories<br>
        </li>
        <li>allow the user to pan and zoom the map</li>
        <li>allow the user to choose a range of months or years or times
          of day and only show the sightings within that time range<br>
        </li>
        <li>the application should update quickly when the user
          interacts</li>
      </ul>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a
        B you need to add ...</span><br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>clicking on the icon for a sighting should show the original
          submitted data</li>
        <li>investigate whether sightings occur near airports by
          plotting the locations of airports and highlighting those
          sightings near an airport and by plotting sightings vs
          distance from the nearest airport on a graph<br>
        </li>
        <li>investigate whether sightings occur in remote areas by
          plotting showing the population of the areas with sightings
          and by plotting the number of sightings vs population density
          on a graph</li>
        <li>investigate how sightings correlate to the time of day/night
          by plotting the number of sightings vs time of day on a graph</li>
        <li>investigate how sightings correlate to months or seasons by
          plotting the number of sightings vs time of year on a graph</li>
        <li>let the user choose specific types of sighting or all
          sightings for these visualizations</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For
        an A you need to add ...</span><br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>allow the user to play back the sightings on the map as a
          movie</li>
        <li>cluster the data to give the user a higher level view of
          where different types of sightings occur</li>
        <li>investigte whether sightings are increasing or decreasing
          over the 2000s<br>
        </li>
        <li>try two other reasonable possible correlations and add that
          data into your interface eg the visibility of venus, locations
          of weather stations, military bases, etc<br>
        </li>
        <li>find some interesting things in the data and highlight them
          on your webpage through screen snapshots</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      As usual you should start by taking a look at the various data
      sources and see the kind of variability you have there and what
      the major issues will be in integrating those various data
      sources.<br>
      <br>
      As with project 2, each Friday each member of the team should post
      a description of what they did on the project to the project web
      site. There are more opportunities in this project for different
      team members to focus on different areas.<br>
      <br>
      There is code that integrates modest maps with processing here:

    <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">As with
      Projects 1 and 2 you should create a set of web pages describing
      your work on the application which has a max size of 1024 x 768 as
      before. This time instead of embedding the processing application
      you should have a link so people can download your application
      (and the necessary data files) to run your application. Please
      make sure that your application is Mac / Windows / Linux
      compatible. If you can get your app to run online through a
      browser then do include that version as well. The web pages should
      also describe the contribution of each team member (ie who worked
      on which interface elements, who worked on converting the data
      into a more usable form, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      Please send me a 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for
      the web. This should be named
      p3.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg. <br>
      <br>
      When the project is done, each person in the group should also
      send me a private email ranking your coworkers on the project on a
      scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in terms of how good a coworker
      they were on the project. If you never want to work with them
      again, give them a 1. If this person would be a first choice for a
      partner on a future project then give them a 5. If they did what
      was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then give them a
      3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a particular
      reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine your
      responses to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will
      average out all these scores for projects 2 through 4 and keep
      them in mind when assigning final grades to projects 2 through 4.<br>
      <br>
      Each group will present their work to the class and describe its
      features to the rest of the class. All team members are expected
      to participate equally in that presentation. <span style="color:
        rgb(255, 255, 0);">Since there are 9 groups each talk will be 4
        minutes long. During each talk each group in the audience should
        write 1 question for the speaking group, and hand it to them at
        the end of their presentation. The speaking group should add a
        page to their website by Thursday 11/3 giving the questions (and
        the group who asked it) and an answer to the question.</span><br>
