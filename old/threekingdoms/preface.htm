<p>The <i>San Guo</i> (Three Kingdoms) is distinctly eastern, a book adapted for
the storytellers; once can almost hear them. It abounds in names and
genealogies, which seem never to tire the readers or listeners.
<p>Japanese, Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, Malay, Indonesian, and possible other
versions of the <i>San Guo</i> have been made, and now to these I have attempted
to add one in English. With what measure of success I leave to curious readers
qualified to compare my rendering with the original.
<p>In conclusion, I wish to put on record my gratitude to Mr. Chen Ti Tsen, who
typed the text, and Mr. E. Manico Gull, who has read the proofs.
<p>C. H. Brewitt-Taylor</p>
------------


<p><i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i> gives us a world of versatility in full
scale---a rolling panorama of human passions and ambitions. 
What makes the book fascinating is its
wide appeal to many kinds of readers. In Asia, children read the book like they
do with fairy tales, whereas politicians embrace it for strategies, scholars wisdoms,
parents guidelines, everyday people entertainment. A Korean saying goes: "You
can discuss life after reading <i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i>." And the
most famous Chinese commentator, Mao Zonggang, who lived in the 17th century at
the start the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), had chosen "Seven Beautiful
Books", and he ranked <i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i> the first among
them.

<p>Several reasons can be explained here on why the historical novel has such a
large group of fans.

<p><i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i> is based closely on historical events (7
parts of facts and 3 parts of fiction); it is considered a mainstream history
work, not a product of pure imagination or fabrication. Hence, it is
extraordinary by itself, because history is the best storyteller.

<p>But, one may ask, China with its rich and widespread civilization has
produced many historical novels, why is <i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i> the
first masterpiece among them all?

<p>First, the strife for mastery over the empire in the Three Kingdoms period is
the most outstanding struggle. Never before has the world
seen so many talents appearing in one same era; a large number of them are
important figures who have left permanent impressions in several fields such as
military, politics, literature, morality, and pop culture; their names are mentioned
in numerous records.

<p>Second, the author of the book is one of the most talented novelists China
has ever had. Writing a novel with a main theme is much more difficult than
writing the annals. In the annals, each topic is dealt with separately; but in <i>Romance
of Three Kingdoms</i>, arranging a huge amount of details into a
continuous epic, and the epic being consistent and captivating, is the author's
greatest achievement.

<p>According to tradition, Luo Guanzhong is the author of the modern edition of
the book. Born at the beginning of the 14th century, he was a scholar in the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), but did not take office. Instead he traveled
throughout with the tittle "The Man of All Lakes and Seas". Some three
hundred years after Luo Guanzhong, Mao Zonggang edited the original work and
made popular the new edition. This English translation is based on the Mao
edition, which is also the most widely read edition in China and Asia.</p>

<p>But the birth of the book can be traced back to the Jin dynasty (265-316 AD).
Chen Shou was believed to be the first to pen <i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i>.
He was an official in Shu-Han court, and later worked for Jin as historian after
Shu-Han's submission. This first edition had 61 chapters---26 stories of Wei, 15
stories of Shu, and 20 stories of Wu. A century after Chen Shou, Emperor Wen of
the Liu-Song dynasty commissioned Pei Songzhi to edit the work. Pei Songzhi
collected a great amount of tales and historical facts and added them to the
book, and this new edition of 65 chapters became mainstream history source for
the Three Kingdoms period. The book went through various minor changes and
inventions, until Luo Guanzhong combined the many sources and rewrote the
masterpiece that gave birth to the Mao edition, which has been handed down until
today.</p>

<p>Not only does <i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i> has a rich history in the
making, but indeed is it picturesque in contents. Its concepts and execution
exact human notions of what are beautiful. Reading it is like contemplating
clouds passing through mountains or storms pouring down the forest, the moon
glowing in autumn or flowers blooming in spring. The evolution of all elements
is infinite. Sometimes, the writing is as serene as a shooting star; other
times, it is as rousing as tidal waves or earthquakes.</p>

<p><i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i> is cherished also due to its perfect
cause-and-effect technique. Before a storm, thunders must be heard; after it,
cold air can be felt. Every detail is traced to its origin and projected beyond
its conclusion; one thing leads to another, so the various focuses relate to
each other, making the main theme whole. The author did not merely record
events, but he helped explain them in a style that all readers love.

<p>Tradition has several guidelines for reading the masterpiece. To avid fans of
history, being able to identify who had a legitimate claim to the empire is
essential. But opinions vary and are subject to changing believes. Some agree
with the ancient, whereas others have their own conclusions. As the result, this
online edition of <i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i> tries to give the readers 
as much information as possible, so that they can judge for themselves.

<p>However, we encourage the readers to do a few things before reading the
novel. First, take a look at the small and big maps of ancient China. Being
familiar to the maps is important for appreciating the many military campaigns
in the book. Second, you can warm up by reading the outlines of Chinese history
from mythology to Three Kingdoms. This section of about 60 pages will acquaint
you to the ancient society and its customs and thoughts.

<p>After that, readers can choose either to read the lecture of Dr. Rafe de
Crespigny about Three Kingdoms, or begin to read the book. The lecture of Dr.
Rafe de Crespigny (about 30 pages) is the most informative writing about <i>Romance
of Three Kingdoms</i> on the Internet. It will give you a complete understanding
of old society in the Three Kingdoms period. This commentary can also serve 
as a perfect afterword. The main book has 120 chapters (about 1,400 pages).

<p>Having finished the book, readers can enjoy the many other writings about <i>Romance
of Three Kingdoms</i> in the Discussion section. You can also enjoy the wisdom
of war strategy through a reading of <i>The Art of War</i> by Suntzu (or Sunzi), a
13-chapter treatise of military methods, famous for its brevity and wide
applications.

<p>With all these writings, we believe you will come to understand and
appreciate the First Masterpiece.
