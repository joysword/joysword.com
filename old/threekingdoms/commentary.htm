<p>The Fifty-first George Ernest Morrison Lecture in Ethnology 1990

<p><b>Introduction</b>

<p>This lecture of Dr Rafe de Crespigny is about the Three Kingdoms. We are so
indebted to Dr Rafe de Crespigny for granting us the permission to present his
commentary to the novel readers.

<p><center><b>Foreword by Dr Rafe de Crespigny</b></center>

<p>George Ernest Morrison was a remarkable man, of great energy, imagination and
influence in the relations between China and the West. From his writings and
papers, moreover, it appears that he was able to maintain a successful balance
between his love and appreciation of China and his own sense of identity as an
Australian.

<p>So the series of lectures established almost
sixty years ago was an appropriate honour to his name, and the topics which have
been covered, from literature and philosophy to politics and economics, present
a remarkable record of the developing interest and scholarship on China in this
country.

<p>We owe a considerable debt to the founders of
this program in the 1930s, and we may hope they would be pleased with the
continuing results of their enterprise.

<p>I feel most honoured to have been invited to
present the Morrison Lecture for 1990. This lecture will deal with times long
ago, but the turmoil of empire and the end of a dynasty are matters that
Morrison knew well.

<p><center><b>Man from the Margin: Cao Cao  and the
Three Kingdoms</b></center>

<p>Cao Cao  was born in AD 155, a subject of the dynasty of
Later Han. His father, Cao Song, was the adopted son of a eunuch
at court, and rose through influence and bribery to the highest position in the
imperial bureaucracy. Cao Cao  himself occupied a number of
middle-range posts at the capital until 189, when the general Dong Zhuo
took advantage of a failed coup d'etat and claimed power for
himself.

<p>The civil war which followed destroyed the
authority of the empire, and for ten years the heart of China was ravaged and
ruined by ragged armies of adventurers, in an infinite permutation of alliances
and treachery.

<p>From this confusion, Cao Cao 
emerged in triumph. He established a coherent government with the Emperor as his
puppet, and by AD 200, when he defeated his chief rival Yuan Shao 
in battle by the Yellow River, he was the master of north China.

<p>In AD 208, however, when Cao Cao 
sought to extend his control to the south, he was defeated and driven back at
the battle of the Red Cliffs, and he never succeeded in breaking the line of the
Great River (the Yangtze or Yangzi).

<p>When Cao Cao  died in AD 220, his
state of Wei still faced two major rivals: Shu-Han in the west under Liu Bei, 
and Wu in the south under the Sun family.

<p>Forty years later, the Sima family
seized power from Cao Cao's successors and established their
own dynasty of Jin, and they conquered Shu and Wu to restore a short-lived unity
to the Chinese world. The position, however, was always insecure and after
little more than twenty years the empire was divided again, with the north
dominated by alien, non-Chinese rulers and peoples. Not until the end of the
sixth century did a single state hold sway once more over the civilised world of
China.

<p>At this stage, let me offer some justification
for the discussion of events so long ago and dynasties so far away. The heroes
of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao, his colleagues and his rivals,
have a notable place in the traditions of the Chinese people. They are
celebrated in poetry and drama, their deeds are recounted in cycles of stories,
and the policies and crises of their time have been the centre of intellectual
and popular debate in modern China.

<p>In that respect, the romance of the Three
Kingdoms holds a place among the Chinese people comparable to the tales of King
Arthur, of Charlemagne and his paladins or, still more relevant to the present
world, of Richard Lionheart and his Crusaders. And if we consider this last
example, and the present events in the Middle East, we can recognise how certain
events in the past, whether or not they are adequately recorded or properly
understood, can influence our perceptions and actions in the present and the
future.

<p>I shall not deal here with the romantic
tradition of the Three Kingdoms: I think we can take that as given, and well
recognised among those who study the field. But since the Morrison Lectures are
concerned to address the ethnography of China, and since the matter of the Three
Kingdoms has been a significant strand in Chinese popular culture for almost two
thousand years, I ask this question: What is it that has made the history of the
Three Kingdoms so special? And since I am basically a historian, I seek to
answer that question by discussing the history, the society and the people of
that time.

<p>So if we deal with that age as it really was,
one question is: Why Three Kingdoms? For scholars of recent times, looking back
over two thousand years of China, the important pattern is that of the great
dynasties, from Han to Tang to Song to Ming to Qing, uniting all under Heaven
for centuries at a time, with physical boundaries generally coterminous with the
extent of Chinese civilisation.

<p>If, however, we look precisely at the end of
Han, we must recognise that the fall of the unified empire was followed by four
hundred years of political division: An age as long as the Han dynasty itself.
The fall of Han was absolute, and it required a different combination of
circumstances for Song and Tang to restore the unity which had been lost for so
long.

<p>Yet there was always a tradition that the
civilised world should be reunited. During the last days of Han, there were
omens and debates on the succession: After twice twelve generations (24
emperors of Later Han), the virtue of the imperial Liu clan was ending,
and who should take over the government? It was, nonetheless, assumed that
government would remain to be taken---no one expected the whole edifice would
break into pieces. There might be a brief period of confusion, but the natural
pattern of unity and peace should be restored.

<p>From this point of view the reputation of Cao
Cao  has suffered: He established government in the heart-land
of China, but he did not destroy his two chief rivals, and the state which he
founded was swiftly subverted and destroyed. As a result, rather than receiving
praise for creating a measure of order out of chaos, Cao Cao 
receives blame for not doing more---and in Confucianist analysis this political
failure is explained by a lack of personal virtue. So Cao Cao 
is painted as cruel and cunning, a brilliant but flawed tyrant, the man against
whom the loyal Liu Bei, the brave Guan Yu, and the
brilliant Zhuge Liang, all men of Shu-Han, could demonstrate
their wisdom, nobility, and skill.

<p>If, however, we escape from political
moralising, and look more objectively at the reality of empire in traditional
China, then the picture becomes a little different.

<p>By the middle of the second century AD, the Han
dynasty was bankrupt, not only in economic terms, but socially and politically
as well. The economic crisis can be traced at least to the beginning of the
first century, in the period after the civil war which brought the destruction
of Wang Mang and the restoration of the Liu family
under Emperor Guang Wu.

<p>The new emperor owed his success to the support
of great landed families, and these were powerful enough to prevent the central
government from enforcing any tight control over their local interests and
activities. In a pattern which became the norm for all dynasties of China, the
local gentry took control of all recruitment to office in the imperial
bureaucracy, and they dominated the workings of government to their own
advantage. In Later Han, the obvious example of their power was the failure of
the new regime to enforce an effective survey of land tenure---so the gentry
maintained their hold on the essential capital of a pre-industrial society;
while the central government was deprived of its full share from the resources
of the nation.<a href="#1">(1)</a>

<p>The effect of this initial weakness was
compounded by mistaken military ambition. At the end of the first century, in
two remarkable series of campaigns, Dou Xian destroyed the state of the Northern
Xiongnu in present day Mongolia, and Ban Chao reestablished Chinese authority
over central Asia, present day Xinjiang. Both generals had close connection to
the court, each of their achievements has been praised by nationalist Chinese
commentators, and the combined effect of their success was imperial disaster.

<p>In strategic terms, the destruction of the
stable and controllable state of the Xiongnu left a political vacuum along the
northern frontier of the empire, and that vacuum was swiftly filled by the
disorganised but aggressive tribes of the Xianbi. Further to the west, the
continued control of central Asia proved to be beyond the resources of the
Chinese government; but as rebellion broke out and the troops were ordered home,
the uncertainty and the loss of prestige brought mutinies and revolt. In
particular, from 107 to 118, the northwest of China was devastated by the
rebellion of the non-Chinese Qiang people. The process continued, and by the
middle of the second century the north and northwest of China was either outside
the control of the imperial government or was under constant and destabilising
attack from beyond the frontier.

<p>In traditional interpretation, it is the rulers
of the second and third centuries who are blamed for allowing the northern part
of China to fall into the hands of "barbarians": It is my contention
that the depopulation and withdrawal which allowed this to happen was a direct
consequence of the excessive and costly aggression by Dou Xian and Ban Chao.<a href="#2">(2)</a>

<p>The military misfortunes I have described had
serious consequences for the government of Later Han. Immediately, the cost of
the wars put direct strain upon the central budget. In the longer term, the loss
of resources from the devastated territories, particularly in the northwest,
meant that shortfall in taxation quotas had to be sought elsewhere, notably from
the settled and prosperous Yellow River plain.

<p>Inevitably, this produced two results: The
weakened central government was unable to enforce its requirements against the
entrenched interests of the local gentry; and the very attempt to do so caused
resentment and disruption.

<p>At the imperial capital, Luoyang,
there was another political development. Throughout the dynasty one emperor
after another had been expected, and often required, to take as his chief
consort a woman from one of the great families of the empire, and the male
members of her family always held high authority at court. The
"usurper" Wang Mang, who seized power from Former
Han, had based his position upon that relationship; the energetic generals Dou
Xian and Ban Chao were imperial relatives by marriage; at the beginning of the
second century the Empress-Dowager Deng and her clan had controlled the court;
and they in turn were succeeded by the Liang family. Each group sought to
maintain itself by sexual politics in the harem and by intrigue at court, but
each in turn was overthrown after one or two generations.

<p>On occasion, the emperor played the chief role
in ridding himself of these over-mighty subjects and their unwanted tutelage,
but he was compelled to rely increasingly upon support from the eunuchs of his
harem. Formally appointed as guardians and jailers of the women, their proximity
to the ruler gave them opportunity to act first as messengers and then as
trusted agents.

<p>In AD 159, when Emperor Huan destroyed
the Liang family, he relied almost entirely upon the support of the eunuchs.
Notably, moreover, he received no useful assistance from the full men of the
gentry who held office in the court and the government, for they were generally
either intimidated by the power of the Liang family, or respected them as
leading members of their own class.<a href="#3">(3)</a>

<p>For the remaining ten years of his reign,
Emperor Huan continued to rely upon the eunuchs and their associates,
promoted them in his service and sought to establish their position in the
empire at large. When he died in AD 168, the gentry officials hoped for better
things under the new regent Dou Wu, whose daughter as Empress had
been forced onto Emperor Huan against his will. A few months later,
however, the eunuchs ran a coup against Dou Wu and his
supporters, they obtained the support of the imperial guard regiments, they
seized control of government under the young Emperor Ling, and they
held that power for the next twenty years.

<p>The period of Liang family hegemony had seen
the development of one group of gentry opposition.

<p>Described by themselves as "Pure",
and known by their later fate as the Proscribed Faction, these men sought to
maintain an ideal Confucianist morality in opposition to the corruption of
government dominated by powerful politicians. Most of the leaders and heroes of
this group came from the middle and lower gentry, and they were energetically
supported by students of the imperial university, thirty thousand strong, who
chanted slogans and scrawled graffiti about the streets and walls of the
capital.

<p>Sadly, however, like other ideal moralists in
later times, the Pure men were more ready to criticise those who held power than
to offer any practical alternative to the problems of government, and they were
readily led to support "reformers" who were primarily concerned with
their own selfish interests.

<p>They played no part in the destruction of the
Liang, and they turned their disapproval with equal and indeed greater censure
against the government of Emperor Huan and his eunuch favourites.<a href="#4">(4)</a>

<p>In AD 166, after several years of skirmishing with
propaganda, the eunuchs persuaded their master to exile the leaders of this
group from office. The men of faction rose to brief power as supporters of Dou
Wu; but when the eunuchs regained power in 168, they confirmed
their success by a purge and proscription of their enemies, and the ban was
maintained for the next fifteen years.

<p>The troubles at the capital were unsettling
enough in themselves, for an impoverished administration, whose government is
punctuated by coups d'etat, is no recipe for imperial success. In more general
terms, however, the conflict between gentry Confucianists and imperial clients
within Luoyang brought a lack of sympathy and loss of allegiance
throughout the whole of China. It can readily be argued that the Pure men of the
Proscribed Party were blinkered in their approach to the problems of government,
and were concerned for the most part with the limited interests of their own
class and background, but they were well armed with the moral courage of their
convictions, and the spectacle of their executions and persecution drove a
brutal wedge between the imperial government and the leading group which should
support the regime.

<p>Already, along the frontier, the empire
maintained a position only at the cost of misery and disruption to the subjects
it should protect. Now, within the country, the perceived moral failures of the
various regimes made men of good will and good family reject an official career.<a href="#5">(5)</a>
And in many respects, this withdrawal from responsibility was more serious for
the fortunes of the dynasty than any feuds, quarrels, and proscriptions at the
capital.

<p>The final, fatal weakness of Han was the loss
of faith among the scholars and gentlemen who should have given their chief
support.

<p>Increasingly, in the provinces, as men sought
their own advantage through private arrangements, the network of commendation,
patronage, and alliance, already established among local families, developed and
grew. Beside and below the official administration, which they dominated through
their influence in the bureaucracy, leaders of the gentry maintained a network
of tenants, retainers, and clients, oppressing and robbing their poorer
neighbours, and contending with one another for local influence and power.

<p>Moreover, for this conservative, politically
stagnant society of the provinces, the threat posed by the arrival of new men
from the capital, eunuchs and their supporters seeking position in the country
for themselves, was a major source of conflict. Though not on a large scale, the
struggles were fierce and cruel on both sides:

<font class=quote>
<p>In one instance, a eunuch associate sought to
marry the daughter of a leading local gentleman. The request was refused, and so
the frustrated suitor led a band of followers to attack the neighbouring
property, kidnapped the unfortunate girl, had her tied to a stake in his
courtyard, and amused himself by shooting arrows at her till she died.
</font>

<p>In response, the local magistrate arrested,
tortured, and killed the ringleader and all his dependents, without regard to
guilt, innocence, age or sex.<a href="#6">(6)</a>

<p>Amongst themselves, these gentlemen could be
equally vicious.

<font class=quote>
<p>The father of Su Buwei was killed in a personal
quarrel by Li Gao, who later became a minister at court. Su Buwei found an
opportunity to tunnel into the minister's residence by night and came to his
bedroom. At that moment, Li Gao had got up to go to the lavatory, so Su Buwei
contented himself by murdering Li Gao's concubine and his infant son. He then
escaped to his home country, dug up the corpse of Li Gao's father from its tomb,
and took the head as an offering to his own father's grave.

<p>Li Gao is said to have died of grief and shame,
but some time later Su Buwei himself, and sixty members of his household, were
killed in revenge by a friend of Li Gao.
</font>

<p>In moral comment upon this unhappy history,
leaders of the Pure faction admired the manner in which Su Buwei had maintained
his vendetta single-handed against official odds.<a href="#7">(7)</a>
<p>Such incidents as these may have been
exceptional, but an almanac for the proprietors of great estates suggests that
the third month is the time to prepare security measures against thieves who may
appear during the food shortages of spring, and in the ninth month the family
should repair its weapons and practise military skills, to be ready for the
attacks of bandits driven by the misery of the coming winter.<a href="#8">(8)</a>

<p>Seen against this background, the tomb models
of Later Han take a new meaning: Those charming towers above the farmyard are
built for serious defence in time of troubles, like the castles of Japan or
medieval Europe. And there are general indications that whereas in Qin Dynasty
and Former Han the wealthy tombs, and the multitudes of model warriors, were
reserved to members of the imperial house, by Later Han the grave goods, and the
warriors, were used by local officials and the leaders of clans. The items are
not of such high quality, but they are more widely spread, both in space across
the provinces of China and in rank amongst the members of the gentry. If a man
took soldiers with him to guard his grave, we may assume he had retained such
services during his life, and it seems very possible that the devolution of
luxury and the symbols of power among the dead reflects a living wealth and a
real independence of local interests against the now limited authority of the
imperial government.

<p>Indeed it was a nice question whether the
dynasty was maintained with the support of the landed gentry and the officials,
or rather for their benefit. To a considerable degree, the attitude of scholars
and the men of good family was one of pious moralising against the imperial
government, combined with a benevolent sympathy, largely unaccompanied by
practical action, for those who were poorer and weaker. And the leaders of the
Pure faction, though they were men of great honour and tragic courage, can also
be regarded as the short-sighted representatives of a selfish landlord class,
primarily concerned with its personal interests, and unable or unwilling to look
beyond to the dangers which threatened society as a whole.

<p>Certainly, for the common people of China, such
conflicts among their betters brought little interest and no advantage: Both
sides were contending for the right to exploit the labour of the subsistence
farmers who comprised more than ninety per cent of the population and produced
almost all of the nation's wealth. In the long term, moreover, the continued
weakness of central government meant that powerful local families could evade
their quotas for taxation and pass the cost onto their tenants or their poorer
neighbours, while the benefits which government should provide, assistance in
time of famine, a measure of good order, and a sense of security, were steadily
disregarded.

<p>In AD 184, first year of a new cycle in the
calendar, the religious leader Zhang Jue, who had
established wide popularity through faith-healing and the preaching of a new
utopia, led a mass uprising across all north China. His followers wore yellow
scarves about their heads, and they fought for a coming era of Great Peace (Taiping).
The rebellion of the Yellow Scarves, however, was essentially a peasant
movement, and it was broken within the year. Whatever their discontent with the
regime at the capital, the great local families were equally concerned to
destroy their enemies below. There was no substantial support for the rebels
among the gentry, and the bulk of the imperial armies were raised in regiments
based upon family retainers and local leadership: Despite the promise of a
better world, the greater part of the people preferred the traditional
relationship of servant and master to the abstract opportunity of escape from
class oppression.<a href="#9">(9)</a>

<p>The immediate result of the uprising was the
slaughter of great numbers of people, the devastation of formerly prosperous
regions, a vast increase in lawlessness and banditry, and an exhaustion of
government. The formal structures of the state remained, but the erosion of
authority was almost complete, and the basis for civil war had been prepared.
The facade of Han relied only upon general acceptance of the imperial
legitimacy---and a reluctance to contemplate what alternatives might take its
place.

<p>In AD 189 the death of Emperor Ling 
renewed the conflict between eunuchs and regular officials. In bloody and
ruinous fighting, each side destroyed the other, and on the evening of 24
September, as flames from the imperial palace lit up the sky, the frontier
general Dong Zhuo came to take over the capital and put his own
nominee, the younger son of Emperor Ling, upon the throne.

<p>Dong Zhuo did not hold power
for very long, but the way he had gained it and the way that he used it meant
the end of legitimate government in the empire. He had no good right to be in
the capital at all, he held his power solely because he was the man in command
of the army, and only another army could remove him. The leaders of the
provinces took up arms to oppose him, and they recruited their armies as they
had against the Yellow Scarves, on a nucleus of local family forces and a
press-ganged conscription.

<p>The "loyal alliance" lasted no more
than a few months, and for the next ten years, as disorder spread across China,
the former structures of power were wiped away. At the beginning, armies were
based upon traditional and local family loyalties, but there rapidly emerged a
distinction between those whose hereditary position allowed them to command such
forces, and the men who could take real advantage of such opportunity. It was
one thing for a gentleman to use his retainers in a feud or bullying against his
neighbours; it was quite a different matter when such clan leaders came face to
face with competent fighting men. One after another, in every region of China,
the amateurs succumbed to the professionals, and the leaders of great lineage
fell victim to the men from the margin.

<p>The career of Cao Cao  is a
model of this process in action. His family background is uncertain, he and his
father owed their position at court to their connection with the eunuchs, and
despite their rank they were not in the same class as the men of great family.
Cao Cao  held minor military command against the Yellow
Scarves, but it was only in AD 190, at the age of thirty-five, that he took an
independent position. His first small army, like the others, was based upon
private resources, but Cao Cao  showed an ability and
imagination that raised him rapidly from the common ruck. In the early years,
moreover, though he suffered some substantial defeats, he showed an exceptional
ability to retain the loyalty of his officers and of the soldiers under his
command, and he gradually developed a warlord state in the territory south of
the Yellow River.

<p>By the middle AD 190s, from this small but secure
base, Cao Cao  achieved two remarkable successes.
<p>Firstly, he took control of the young Emperor
Xian, maintaining him as a puppet to legitimate his personal power.
Second, still more important, Cao Cao  established a system of
military agricultural colonies, which resettled peasants dispossessed by war
onto fields that others had abandoned. The new tenants were allocated land under
direct control of the government, without intervention from the former
landlords: And in ready exchange they defended their territory and produced
reliable supplies for armies further afield. None of his rivals were willing or
able to match this administrative coup, and the power of his state grew without
interruption.

<p>In AD 200, at the battle of Guandu 
just south of the Yellow River, Cao Cao  destroyed the army of
his greatest enemy, Yuan Shao, and in the following years he
took over all of north China from the Great Wall to the River Huai and the River
Han.

<p>In AD 208, however, as Cao Cao 
sought to take control of the middle Great River, his initial success was halted
at the Red Cliffs near present day Wuhan. The engagement itself was not a major
one, but the tactical setback had great strategic consequences, for the armies
of the south, notably the forces of Wu under Sun Quan, were
able to maintain defences on the line of the Great River for more than seventy
years thereafter, and this success established the foundations for the future
division of China into Northern and Southern dynasties.

<p>In immediate terms, there were several reasons
why Cao Cao  failed at the Red Cliffs. For one thing, he was
not fully committed to success. His own army had been on active service for
several years, and was barely returned from a triumphant campaign north of the
Great Wall. His initial thrust had secured the basin of the River Han, and it
appears most likely that his further advance was made rather in the hope of
swift success against weak and divided enemies than in the determination to
embark on a thorough conquest. Once he had suffered a setback, it was better
policy to return and secure the government of his base territory than to
continue and perhaps over-commit himself too far from home. There should always
be another opportunity.<a href="#10">(10)</a>

<p>In fact, the opportunity never came: Though the
armies of Wei, under Cao Cao  and his successors, repeatedly
attacked the line of the middle and lower Great River, they never obtained a
position in the south. In part, this lack of success can be ascribed to the
obstacle of the Great River and the difficulty of organising major amphibious
operations over such a distance. Besides this, however, it is evident that
Chinese colonisation and control in the south was now sufficient to support a
separate state.

<p>During Later Han, through the first and second
centuries AD, the registered population of China south of the Great River had
more than doubled, both in simple numbers and as a proportion of the empire as a
whole, from seven to fifteen percent. The increase came largely through
migration, as men sought to escape from the troubles and oppression of the
north, and it was confirmed by settlement of agricultural land and by
intermarriage with the people of the south. Often enough, this steady incursion
had been resisted by the earlier inhabitants, who saw themselves driven from
their lands by the new settlers, but these occasional "rebellions"
were put down by local or imperial armies, and the expansion of the Chinese
people at the expense of their neighbours was maintained, as for the following
two thousand years, without great difficulty.

<p>This spread of Chinese power meant that, once
he had been able to secure a short-term frontier along the Great River, the
government of Sun Quan was able to confirm that defence line
with men, ships, and fortifications. Moreover, the state of Wu then embarked
upon a program of conquest and colonisation through its southern territories,
forcing more people, both Han and non-Chinese, into its service, and turning
these human resources into defence against the north. In this respect, the
southern expansion of Chinese culture created and confirmed the division of the
Chinese world.<a href="#11">(11)</a>

<p>In other directions, Cao Cao 
and his successors were able to take over the territory formerly controlled by
Han in Manchuria and northern Korea, and they reestablished contact with
dependent states in central Asia. It was not possible, however, to restore the
Chinese position along the northern frontier, for that land had been lost and
abandoned by the government of Han: All that could be done was to recognise a
number of petty chieftains and seek to keep them under some control, and it was
from that region, notably present day Shanxi, that the non-Chinese dynasties
developed their power in the following century.

<p>Finally, to the west in present day Sichuan,
the warlord adventurer Liu Bei, his minister Zhuge Liang, and their local successors concentrated their energies on
military aggression against Wei. Their efforts were ineffectual, and beyond the
strength of a single province, but the state of Shu-Han survived for more than
fifty years primarily because the power of the north could not be concentrated
in that direction so long as there was an active threat across the Great River
from the south. Only after the death of Sun Quan, when the
government of Wu was demoralised by succession struggles, could the new dynasty
of Jin [of the Sima family] concentrate against Shu-Han and then
turn to conquer the south.

<p>Cao Cao  died in AD 220 as a
formal subject of Han, and the dynasty was not ended until the enforced
abdication of Emperor Xian in favour of his son Cao Pi 
at the end of that year. By that time, however, the frontiers of the Three
Kingdoms---Wei, Shu-Han and Wu---had been established by thirty years of war,
and the pattern of their conflict had been largely determined by the
developments of previous centuries. Of these the most important were the
weakness in the north, due to the over-expansion by Later Han against the
Xiongnu, and the strength of the south, brought by a steady, now accelerated,
colonisation south of the Great River.

<p>It would be sadly dull, however, if all such
history should be explained merely in terms of geography, demography, and
economics, and indeed it would be wrong to try to do so. Within the pattern of
their time, Cao Cao, his associates and rivals made their way
by individual achievement, and this is the real and human story of the Three
Kingdoms.

<p>Firstly, we should recognise again the degree
to which the old regime of the Han was destroyed in the first years of civil
war. The authority of the government at the capital, already shaken by the
internal quarrels and the rivalries of the eunuchs and their opponents, had been
completely eliminated by the usurpation of Dong Zhuo, and the
emperor himself became no more than a pawn in the politics of the warlords. And
at the same time, during this fight to the finish, the traditional power
structure of the provinces, based upon hereditary control by great landed
families, was utterly destroyed.

<p>Yuan Shao, last great rival of
Cao Cao  in the north, is a notable example of the gentlemen
who had held influence under Han and whose power was destroyed in the civil war.
The Yuan family had held the highest offices of state for generations
and their network of allies and clients extended across the empire. Yuan Shao
had played a leading role against the eunuchs and when the
alliance was formed against Dong Zhuo he was swiftly elected as
leader. The influence and prestige of his family, and the military power which
he acquired upon that basis, were sufficient to overwhelm his neighbours north
of the Yellow River; and until he encountered Cao Cao  face to
face, he had met no substantial setback. The defeat at Guandu in
AD 200, however, was more than a tactical misfortune, for Yuan Shao's 
main army disintegrated, and he was never able to return to the attack. Yuan
Shao died soon afterwards, his sons quarrelled amongst
themselves, and they died landless in exile.

<p>The matter of controlling and maintaining an
army in being was central to the success of Cao Cao  and the
failure of Yuan Shao. For the armies of this time were
ramshackle affairs. The small regular forces of the Han dynasty, professional
soldiers based at the capital and experienced troops on the northern frontier,
had been well-disciplined and efficient, but elsewhere in the empire the
government of Later Han had been more concerned about the loyalty of its people
than with the need for competent soldiers, and it maintained no general system
of militia training.

<p>In civil war, as the mobilisations of the
warlords brought vast numbers to the competing banners, there were neither time
nor resources for proper training. Many men with experience in the old imperial
army gained advancement as commanders of the new recruits, but their units were
overwhelmed by the hordes of newcomers, and the traditions, skills and
discipline were lost. As for equipment, uniforms, supply, and general
coordination, the texts indicate either that they were completely lacking or,
when they were present, that this was considered exceptional.

<p>In reality, these armies were simple armed
mobs, with landless troops driven variously by loyalty or fear, by personal
desperation, and by the hope of plunder. And they were accompanied by a mass of
camp-followers---women and children, cooks and prostitutes, peddlers and
gamblers, and a few who specialised in care of the sick and wounded. In the ruin
of the society of the past, these masses of ragged misery joined the command of
any chieftain who might gain them a measure of security.

<p>So the structure and fighting techniques of
these armies were based upon small groups of men following individual leaders.
The heart of each unit was the commander himself, supported by his
"companions", skilled soldiers who owed him personal allegiance and
served as a body-guard, and the most important tactic was expressed in the
phrase "to break the enemy line". In aggressive action, the commander
and his companions acted as spearhead for a drive at the enemy array; and if
they were successful, they could hope to be followed by the mass of their
followers, spreading out to attack the broken enemy from the flank and the rear.

<p>Such tactics have been used at other times and
places, and the reliance upon mass, concentrated at one point, is a natural
technique for an ill-disciplined force, but it is a frightening operation for
the leaders of a primitive army, with no certainty of support. Such attack
requires great courage from the leader and his immediate followers, and a high
level of personal authority to attract his men to follow in the charge. So if we
read in the stories how one man held a bridge, or another advanced alone against
an army, some part of the tale may be true:

<p>Here, for example, is an attack from the Great
River: <a href="#12">(12)</a>

<font class=quote>
<p>Two great ships were moored to narrow the
entrance, with heavy ropes stretched between them and stones attached as
anchors. Above this line of defence were a thousand men with crossbows for
covering fire. The arrows poured down like rain, and the army could not get
forward.

<p>Dong Xi and Ling Tong were together in the van. Each took charge of a forlorn horde of volunteers, all
in double armour. They boarded a great barge, charged between the covered boats,
and Dong Xi himself cut the ropes with his sword. The enemy
craft were swept down-stream, and the main body of the army was able to attack.
</font>

<p>For the most part, the new leaders came from
lower gentry or comparable background, for they needed access to some group of
supporters in order to begin a military career. Sun Jian,
father of the first emperor of Wu, was probably the son of a merchant, and he
first went to war with a few hundred personal and family followers.

<p>Liu Bei, future sovereign of
Shu, claimed distant descent from the house of Han, but his father had held only
minor office. Like many others, he and his sworn brothers Guan Yu
and Zhang Fei came first to prominence in fighting against the
Yellow Scarves. Thereafter, at onetime or another, and with limited military
success, Liu Bei  served or allied himself to every major
warlord, and his seizure of power in the west came as the natural culmination of
a long record of double-dealing. He must have been, however, a man of remarkable
quality, for he retained a reputation for honour and generosity, and he
attracted and held the loyalty of his followers even in the days of his weakness
and apparent failure.

<p>Indeed, at every level, success and survival
depended almost entirely upon the leaders' personal quality. Not only did they
require the military skill to attack against odds, they also needed the
authority and style to attract and hold men in their service and support in
battle. And the fighting commanders were men of flamboyant personality,
arrogant, luxurious, often quick-witted, frequently brutal, not easy for anyone
to deal with:

<font class=quote>
<p>Gan Ning would kill for
pleasure, and he gave outlaws refuge and lodging in his offices. Whenever he
went in or out, if he was on land, there were horsemen and chariots drawn up in
array, and if he travelled by water, there were lines of small craft, all with
followers in embroidered clothing. Wherever he halted, he used a silken rope to
moor the boat, and when he moved on again, he cut the rope and left it, to show
how little he cared.<a href="#13">(13)</a>

<p>Pan Zhang was a rough, fierce
man, whose orders were always respected. He loved to play a fine part, but he
began as an impoverished drunkard: when creditors came to his gate, he simply
assured them that one day he would be wealthy and powerful, and he would repay
them then. Later, when he held command, he would steal for the benefit of his
men and on his own account; and if one of his officers or soldiers happened to
be well off, he would sometimes kill him and take his property.<a href="#14">(14)</a>

<p>Zhu Huan, as general of Wu on
campaign against Wei, quarrelled bitterly with his commander-in-chief, killed
numbers of his attendants, and then "pretended he was insane" and left
the army. Sun Quan, however, soothed him down, treated him
with honour, and returned him to the front with a largely independent command.
Zhu Huan remarked that now he had the opportunity to return to active service,
his ailment would cure itself.<a href="#15">(15)</a>
</font>

<p>In this society of war, therefore, there was a
new hierarchy of heroes: Men of remarkable, often foolhardy, courage and
personality---mad, bad, and dangerous to know---subject only to those few
exceptional rulers who could control their energies and hold their loyalty.

<p>In the great campaigns, those which decided the
fortunes of a state, there was a limited, but vital, role for high command. A
major force, thirty thousand men or more, occupied a vast area of ground and
placed heavy demands on the resources of an even wider territory. It was
composed of disparate units with individual leaders, much of whose time was
spent in foraging, while poor techniques of communication restricted all
attempts at control and manoeuvre. The real requirement was not for a brilliant
strategy: The essential thing was to maintain the army in being---and frequently
this was more than the generals could manage.

<p>For in these circumstances, the question of
morale was a matter of vital moment, and every leader had to recognise that the
mass of troops at his command was both brittle and volatile. If either side
suffered a reverse, if the defence gave way or an attack was checked, if a
notable leader was discomfited or slain, numbers of men would be confused and
uncertain, and they could rapidly fall into panic and flight. Inevitably, at
some stage, this was going to happen---the important question was whether the
commander, at whatever level he was operating, could restore the situation and
rally his troops again to his banner.

<p>This was the critical difference between
success and failure in the civil war, and in more general terms it provides a
measure of the achievement of Cao Cao. Faced with the ruin of
Han, with military and political chaos over the whole of China, Cao Cao 
reconstructed a functioning government and restored a measure of good order
across the great part of the empire. Given the nature of the fighting men that
he had to deal with, ebullient, fierce and egocentric, he and his rivals Liu Bei
, Zhuge Liang and Sun Quan,
can only be admired for their strength of personality and their ability to
manage their followers.

<p>I turn to another question: Can we say that the
unity of empire was more desirable than the opportunities provided by division?
For many regions, and notably the south, separation from a central government
meant that the wealth of the territory remained to benefit the local people.
During Han, the system of the Grand Canal had drained prosperity from the
southern frontier to the luxury of Luoyang and its mistaken ambitions
in the north. Under Wu, however, the Great River was developed as a great
trading route between the east and the centre of China, while the profits of
trade from the southern seas supported a splendid city at present-day Nanjing [Shidou
], whose culture would rival and complement that of the older
centres on the Yellow River plain.

<p>Indeed, the splendour of these rival courts,
their palaces and their capitals, provided a means for the rulers to impress
their subjects. Cao Cao  did much to restore the city of
Luoyang, but he also expressed his authority by the embellishment of
two other capitals, Xuchang and Yejun, south and north
of the Yellow River. In 210, when he built the Copper Bird Terrace at Yejun, 
his brilliant son Cao Zhi celebrated the
construction in impromptu verse:<a href="#16">(16)</a>

<p>On a pleasure-tour with the brilliant ruler,<br>
We climb the storied terrace with feelings of delight;<br>
We see all the palace stretched out below,<br>
And we gaze upon the works of wisdom and virtue:<br>
He has raised great gates like rugged hills,<br>
He has floated twin turrets into the clouds,<br>
He has built a splendid tower to reach the heavens,<br>
He has joined flying bridges to the western walls.<br>
We look down to the long thread of the Zhang River,<br>
We look out to the flourishing growth of the orchards;<br>
We lift our heads to the gentle majesty of the spring breeze,<br>
And we hear the competing cries of a hundred birds.<br>
The heavenly work is established firm as a wall,<br>
The wishes of our house are brought to fulfillment,<br>
Good influence reaches all the world,<br>
And every respect and reverence is paid to the capital;<br>
Though the hegemonies of the past were magnificent,<br>
How can they compare to your wisdom and virtue?


<p>Both the theme and the author symbolize two
notable aspects of the state of Wei, for Cao Zhi is admired as
one of the greatest poets of China. Cao Cao  himself was a man
of considerable literary talent, and his eldest son and heir Cao Pi 
had genuine ability as a composer and scholar of literature.

<p>In practical terms, moreover, restoration and
embellishment of their cities was the outward sign of legitimacy for the new
rulers. For although Liu Bei  in Shu-Han would claim the imperial
title in right of the Liu family, the rulers of Wei and Wu had no such
concern: Their mandate relied upon simple possession of power. The virtue of the
rival states could be judged only on the basis of their political and military
success, in the restoration of effective government, not upon any claim to ideal
moral virtue. The emperors of Han had been criticised with portents---accidents
in the heavens or on earth, reported to show how the faults of the ruler were
disturbing the harmony of the universe <a href="#17">(17)</a>---but such charges
were of no effect against the new regime.

<p>The enemies of Cao Cao 
slandered him by propaganda, in stories told with relish to this day, but for
the time being at least, the complaints of morality were irrelevant, and a
reputation for trickery and ruthlessness added awe and imagination to his name.
<p>At the same time, Cao Cao  and
his sons gathered about them writers, poets and scholars, respected and admired
in their own time and in subsequent generations, who gave an intellectual
splendour to what need otherwise have been no more than a military government.

<p>The poets of this period, moreover, restored
the voice of individuals. For the most part, during Han, literary expression had
been concerned primarily with the interests of government and the leaders of
society. The splendid rhapsodies of Fu presented, either in admiration or
criticism, the glories of empire, and the lyrics of the Yue Fu described,
certainly with sympathy but without personal involvement, the life of the common
people. As the security of the past collapsed in ruins, however, Wang Can
, Chen Lin, and other "Masters of the
Jianan Period" expressed their sorrows not only for the nation as a whole,
but for their own sense of its misery. In a splendid early model of the new
style, his "Rhapsody on Climbing a Tower" written in exile to the
south, Wang Can alternates the sights and sounds of nature to
counterpoint his own sense of loneliness and frustration.<a href="#18">(18)</a>
Later, when he came to join Cao Cao's court, he and his
colleagues, including the young Cao Pi and Cao Zhi,
formed friendships which were expressed in poems written one to another. And
this sense of personal identity among gentlemen was now expressed in a new style
of literature, immensely important to later generations and centuries in the
future.

<p>For in this new world, as Cao Cao 
claimed repeatedly, with all the old patterns of society brought to ruin,
individual talent was the one thing essential to success. There was no room for
concern about background or personal morality, the only question was ability,
whether it be on the field of battle, in council of war, or in the
administration of settled territory:

<font class=quote>
<p>I have never heard that a state could be
established and restored when its officials were incompetent and its soldiers
would not fight..... In times of peace, we may admire fine virtue, but in time
of trouble it is achievement and ability which obtain rewards. And so long a man
has ability, I can use him.<a href="#19">(19)</a>
</font>

<p>For masses of the people, of course, such
opportunity never arose, many of the newcomers had no more than a short-lived
career, and some men of lineage were able to maintain and restore their family
prosperity for generations to come, but in each case it was the individual who
had to seize and seek their own fortune.

<p>And it was not only in war and government, but
also in society and in the life of the mind, that the Three Kingdoms offered a
career open to the talents. The imagination and energy of scholars and thinkers
were directed not only to politics and literature but also to fields of
philosophy which had been largely blocked by the tradition of Han Confucianism.
While Buddhism still remained to some extent on the margin, interest in the
individual rather than the ideal of society brought a revival of indigenous
Chinese thought, centred on the study of the three Mysteries: The Classic of
Changes, the Daode Jing and the Book of Zhuangzi.<a href="#20">(20)</a>

<p>In similar fashion, this freedom of thought and
openness of opportunity created one of the few periods in Chinese history when
women had the opportunity to influence affairs directly rather than hide behind
a screen. The Lady Wu, mother of Sun Quan, played a
substantial role in council, and Sun Quan's sister, married
to Liu Bei, is said to have dominated his household and
terrified her husband with the aid of a personal following of a hundred female
attendants, all of them trained in arms. Sun Quan's
daughters, in more traditional style, disrupted his court with intrigue, and
when one became the mistress of his chief minister, she had her sister put to
death.

<p>In the north, though Cao Cao 
acknowledged more than thirty children by different women, he gave his loyalty
to the Lady Bian, a former sing-song girl who became Queen and Empress
Dowager of Wei. His son and successor Cao Pi, after an
impetuous but tragic marriage with the widowed daughter-in-law of Yuan Shao
, chose as his empress the Lady Guo, a woman of minor
gentry stock who had at onetime been a servant. So the imperial family of Wei
defied the tradition of Han: They chose their consorts from families which could
offer neither support nor rivalry to the throne, and it seems very probable that
they held them in genuine affection.

<p>In the longer term, however, the marriage
policy of Wei deprived the imperial lineage of prestige and political support.
Increasingly, moreover, the former pattern of Han society, dominated by powerful
families, emerged again under the ambit of the new empires. Many great clans had
been destroyed in civil war, but others submitted to the new rulers and
maintained their local position largely intact, while many new men of the
conquerors, exposed too greatly to the chances of war and politics, either fell
victim themselves or failed to pass on their great position to descendants.
<p>In this way, as the Three Kingdoms stabilised,
the rival governments, primarily concerned with intrigue at the capital and
problems on the frontiers, were unable to maintain close authority against the
local magnates. The apex of government, recorded by the histories with tales of
generals and ministers and intrigue at court, rested upon a broad class of
village and county gentry, who might accept local office, but who had small
concern with the politics of the capital or the fortunes of the state. So the
pattern of the last years of Later Han was restored: Basic dues were paid to the
imperial court, but the details of its activities were largely irrelevant to
local power, influence and survival.

<p>Inevitably, moreover, as the rulers became more
isolated from their most powerful subjects, the basis of authority was whittled
away. Gradually the military units, the civilian administration, and the
agricultural colonies of Wei, fell back into hereditary control, while the
splendours and imagination of the court and the capital, which had formerly
served to enhance the prestige and legitimacy of the new states, became sources
of resentment and disapproval. The power of government, heart of Cao Cao's
reconstruction of the state, was steadily eroded to the
advantage of local interests and the power of great families.

<p>As a result of this process, when the Sima
family seized power in Wei, they obtained support as representatives
of the great clans against the Cao. In practice, the opponents of the
imperial state sought their own interests, but they identified those interests
with a true morality, and they regarded themselves as men of traditional
"Confucian" virtue, contending against authoritarian
"Legalist" principles and the absurd excesses of philosophical
speculation---the policies of the Sima echoed real concern for a
structure of power which would give proper respect to gentlemen of quality and
substance.

<p>In this respect, one essential aspect of the
Three Kingdoms was a struggle between two forms of political society. On one
side was the gentry-bureaucratic tradition of Han, which had successfully defied
the imperial government and dominated the state with a structure of family and
clan linkage, of alliances and clients, networks of connections and a local
hierarchy of oppression and control.

<p>On the other side was the structure by which
Cao Cao  and his associates had attempted to restore order from
the chaos of the second century: A powerful, authoritative government, with
political and social status determined by individual ability rather than by
inherited position.<a href="#21">(21)</a>

<p>That model, however, was too fragmented and
brittle to survive for long against the self-interested alliance of the great
lineages, and the people who might have benefited from such a structure were
either too selfish to maintain it or too anxious to seek security as allies and
clients of the hereditary chieftains. The Chinese reverted very quickly to the
traditional structure, and the power of class and clan remained the backbone of
government, not only in the centuries of division, but also in the great
dynastic empires which followed.

<p>So I suggest this is one reason why tales of
the Three Kingdoms have remained so strongly embedded in the popular culture of
China: Beside the excitement and imagination of the stories themselves, there is
the memory of one brief moment when some individuals could seize their
opportunities and break through the barriers of class and clan.

<p>Cao Cao, indeed, was a model
of the process. When he was young, a celebrated judge of character described him
as:

<font class=quote>
<p>A good subject in time of peace, a crafty hero
in time of trouble.<a href="#22">(22)</a>
</font>

<p>As a man of character and enterprise, he would
have remained restricted and frustrated in an organised society. It was the ruin
of empire which brought opportunity, and he and his fellows were no longer small
fish in a well-controlled pond, but dragons in mighty waters.
<p>It was a moment of personal liberty which was
not maintained, but the legend has been admired by the oppressed of every
generation since that time, and the heroes of that age have been taken as
examples of those who controlled their own destiny.
<p>As Cao Cao  said in one of his
poems,<a href="#23">(23)</a> despite the difficulties and miseries of war,

<p>The
swift steed in old age may rest in his stable,<br>
But he still thinks of a thousand mile journey;<br>
When a hero comes to the end of his days,<br>
Strong heart remains the same.<br>
The time of our life and death<br>
Is more than the whim of Heaven;<br>
If a man is in harmony with himself,<br>
He may live for long years.

<p>And, in continuing chorus:

<p>Fortune indeed has come;<br>
And singing expresses our hopes.

<p>So if it is asked: Why should we be concerned
with the history of men and events so long ago? I suggest, with appropriate
caution, three strands for an answer: The literary style is better; the
bloodshed is further away; but the lessons are as enduring as the people of
China.

identify Chinese texts which have been specifically quoted or cited; second, to
offer a first reference, in my own works or those of other scholars, to justify
particular statements. In a format such as this, it is hardly appropriate to
provide a complete set of citations nor a full bibliography, and I make no
attempt to do so.

[general editors], The Cambridge History of China, Volume I (edited by Denis
Twitchett and Michael Loewe), The Ch'in and Han Empires, Cambridge UP 1986
(hereafter Cambridge China I), 619-626. Cho-yun Hsu, Han Agriculture: The
Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy, University of Washington, Seattle
1980, 210-211, cites several instances of officials being punished by Emperor
Guangwu for presenting false or inadequate returns but, as Hans Bielenstein, The
Restoration of the Han Dynasty (RHD) 4, in Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern
Antiquities (BMFEA) LI, 136-137, and Ch'ü T'ung-tsu, Han Social Structure,
University of Washington, Seattle 1980, 203-204, observe, there is evidence that
corruption continued, and the government of Later Han made no effective effort
to control the amount of landed property held by any one family.

between the gentry members of the Proscribed Party and the rebels of the Yellow
Turbans. From my own reading of the texts, however, I have so far found the
evidence for such a proposition to be tenuous, and the arguments less than
convincing.
