    <h1 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Project 2 - Have you Seen the
      Saucers?<br>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Due Monday
      3/05/12 at 8:59pm Chicago time</p>

      This project will focus on using OpenCL to do a particle
      simulation which talks to OpenGL to display the particles.<br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;">
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
        You will be simulating what happens to a large number of people
        in the Mall area as the Washington DC area is visited by flying
        saucers. Think Earth vs the Flying Saucers or Mars Attacks! or
        the Day the Earth Stood Still (the original).<br>
        <br>
        Each of these people on the ground will be a boid (<a
          href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/</a>)
        with some fairly simple rules of action, and limited to 2D
        motion, and rotation around only 1 axis. The people in the
        simulation will not have the same amount of desire to match
        velocity and alignment as birds, but there will still be some of
        that in the way they move in groups. The more important
        behaviour is to avoid collisions with other entities and with
        the environment. You are encouraged to enhance these rules as
        long as they stay within the spirit of the simulation. <br>
        <br>
        The people will initially be milling around the mall - some may
        be stationary but many should have a particular destination in
        mind (Lincoln Memorial, Capital, White House, Smithsonian).
        People will movie around and try to space themselves out. The
        user will then be able to 'launch' one or more flying saucers
        into the area from a side of the map and the people will try to
        run away from each saucer. <span style="color: rgb(255, 255,
          255);">People have only a limited perceptual range so people
          far from the UFOs will not know they are there until the
          people running away from it reach them. </span>People can not
        run into/onto buildings, but they can run down the streets and
        on the grass. People should move at a normal human rate. </span><span
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The people
        should only be able to pack so close together. If a flying
        saucer moves away then the people will spread back out.<br>
        <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
        flying saucers can fly over all the buildings and the grass and
        the water and the bridges, since all the buildings in DC are
        lower than the Washington Monument, but they should not be able
        to fly over the Washington Monument and should fly smoothly
        around it.</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
        The flying saucers should generally move towards the people and
        try to hover over them. If a flying saucer flies over a person
        then there is a percentage chance that something happens to that
        person. The person must remain an active boid but their rules of
        behaviour may change. Do they become homicidal cucumber-human
        hybrids chasing after other humans? Are they given free iPhones
        and chase after the UFOs to get more? The changed humans should
        change colour or shape at this point. Come up with something
        clever. Based on the saucer's intent the saucers should leave
        after some point (e.g. they run out of iPhones to give out).<br>
        <br>
        Your goal is to simulate a LOT of people.<span
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> You should
          have a visible counter of the number of people who in the
          various states.<br>
          <br>
          There are several map servers out there - </span></span><span
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">www.openstreetmap.org</span></span><span
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">,
          maps.google.com, open.mapquest.com, etc - where you can get
          your map data. This map data can serve as both a backdrop to
          show where the action is happening and as data for working out
          where the entities are able to move.<br>
          <br>
          The simulation visuals should update at a reasonable rate -
          i.e. at least 15 frames per second, and the simulation itself
          should run at a reasonable rate. The people and the UFOs
          should move and turn smoothly, not abruptly.<br>
          <br>
          <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        </span> <br>
        For a C you need to implement the above project<br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <span
              style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> In a
              1024 by 768 window showing a static view of the city</span></span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
              style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">With one
              UFO</span></span></li>
        <li><span style=" font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
              style=" font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Either a
              map view or satellite / aerial photography view<br>
            </span></span></li>
        <li><span style=" font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
              style=" font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A clever
              idea for the plot of your simulation (what the flying
              saucers are up to)<br>
            </span></span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <br
            style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> For a B
          you need to add:</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      </span>
      <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <li>Pan and Zoom the map while keeping all of the people and
          UFOs active and updating, including those off-screen at the
          moment</li>
        <li>Ability to change the rate of time passing<br>
        </li>
        <li> Ability to switch between map view and satellite / aerial
          photography view<br>
        </li>
        <li>Ability to spawn multiple UFOs that stay out of each others
          way</li>
        <li>The military will attack the UFOs. The military boids will
          be a different colour from any of the other boids. Some will
          be scattered around the DC area and more will move in from the
          Pentagon. If military people are under the saucer they will
          degrade it, and can eventually destroy it - based on your
          scenario this is either a good thing or a bad thing. There
          should be an obvious way of seeing what condition the saucer
          is in.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
        <br>
        For an A you need to add:<br>
      </span>
      <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <li>Add in another city for the saucers to visit to show your
          solution is general<br>
        </li>
        <li>Document optimization experiments in OpenCL on your web
          page.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><span
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></div>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;">
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:

    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">As with the previous project, to turn in your project
      you should set up a web page describing your work, the
      well-commented source code and required files to be able to
      compile and run your program, and a movie in a common web-viewable
      format showing what your application should look like when its
      running. You should then email andy with the location of this
      website before the deadline. It&nbsp; would probably be a good
      idea to put a backup copy of the web page at a second website just
      in case I can't get to the first one.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When




        you send andy the location of your webpage you should again
        email a screen snapshot of your head that is 320 pixels wide by
        240 pixels tall in jpeg format named
        &lt;your_last_name&gt;.p2.jpg. This image will be used on the
        class web pages along with the link to your project web page.</span></p>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;">
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As with the
        previous project, each student will also give a presentation
        about their project in-class and answer some questions about
        your work. This time the presentation will be 15 minutes long.
        You should prepare a good presentation - you can use your
        project website, or create some slides. You should definitely
        run your code and talk about how you structured the computation
        in OpenCL. Be sure to practice your presentation so you finish
        within the allotted time so everyone has equal time to present.</span><br>
