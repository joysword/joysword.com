<blockquote>
<p>　　<em>Going into this MLG, the first Dota 2 MLG, I didn’t really know what to expect. Never having been to Columbus before, that added to the mystique. In the end, I came out of it with a truly unforgettable experience, friendships, and a new-found understanding for why so many pro players are so damn skinny. I apologize in advance for the relative lack of pictures, as it’s a personal thing for me to not abuse my access when I’m invited to an event. This is my point of view from MLG Columbus 2013 as both an invitee to help with DK, and as a Dota 2 fan there for the spectacle, and finally, as a DK fan.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>加入这次MLG，第一次有dota2的MLG，我并不真的知道能期待些什么。我从没去过Columbus，这也增加了神秘感。但到最后，我发现这真的是难忘的经历，建立了难忘的友谊，并且知道了为什么这么多职业选手这么尼玛瘦。首先我要道歉配的图片比较少，因为我不能滥用权利。这篇文章是从我的视角来看MLG Columbus 2013，既是作为一个被邀请来协助DK的人，也是作为一个到现场的粉丝，最后，也作为一个DK战队的粉丝。</em></p>

<h4>Thursday Nov 21, 2013 | 2013年11月21日 星期四</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>　　I left home in Seattle at 5am sharp to catch a series of flights that would guarantee I arrive in Columbus with a few hours to spare before DK’s plane was scheduled to arrive, the reason being that my first duties for MLG Columbus entailed being at the airport with the hired van driver to pick up DK and get them to the hotel. MLG had rented a big comfy van and a driver for this purpose, and around 9pm I got the call from the driver downstairs of the hotel and we headed over to the airport. Whilst waiting, Sigma and NaVi both went by and Dendi noticed me, got a goofy grin on his face and waved, to which I grinned back and waved probably even more goofily. His team seemed to be like “what you doing bro” and he gestured in my general direction. A brief time later, and the first of DK appeared at the foot of the escalators, coming down from the upper level of the airport to the baggage claim area. iceiceice, Mushi, and MMY, then BurNIng and LaNm. BurNIng smiled, somewhat surprised I was there I suppose, but seemed happy enough. A familiar face after nearly a full day of travel, perhaps? I waved as they approached, greetings were made, and iceiceice asked some random questions. We waited for their checked bags, and then we were off to the van to the hotel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　早上5点（Columbus时间7点，北京时间晚上9点）整我离开西雅图的家去赶一系列的飞机，以便能比DK早几小时到达Columbus，因为我需要带领雇来的面包车司机一起去接DK回酒店。MLG租了一台又大又舒适的面包车来干这活，大约晚上9点（北京时间周五11点）司机在酒店楼下给我打电话，我们于是就出发去机场。在等待时，Sigma和NaVi到了，Dendi注意到了我，对我傻笑并挥手，我也报以微笑，并更傻地挥了挥手。他的队友看起来一副’兄弟你在干嘛呢’的样子，Dendi指了指我这个方向。一小段时间之后，第一名DK队员出现在扶梯上，从楼上下来取行李。iceiceice，Mushi和MMY，然后是BurNIng和LaNm。BurNIng笑了笑，我觉得他看到我在这儿有些惊讶，但也很开心。也许是经历了一整天的旅程之后终于看到熟悉的面孔了吧。他们走来的时候我挥了挥手，大家问了好，iceiceice问了一些奇怪的问题。等他们拿到行李，我们就上车回酒店了。</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/caX8bOg.jpg" alt="Team DK at the Columbus Airport">

<blockquote>
<p>　　On the way to the hotel, I asked if they were hungry, and hungry they were. After getting them into their rooms and dropping their stuff off, by this time it was nearly 11pm, and so we simply decided on getting them food at the bar on the second floor of the Hilton. They got some pizza and wings, and LaNm wanted a burger, so he got that too. Iceiceice got a single pork belly slider - it was good, he said. While eating, MLG’s Adam happened upon us, and the introductions were made. Awesome guy, super straightforward kinda dude, he made sure that DK were as comfortable as they could be with their accommodations and filled me in on the basics of what to expect for the weekend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　在路上，我问他们饿不饿，他们果然很饿。在回房间放下东西以后，已经11点多了（北京时间次日下午1点），我们决定只是去希尔顿2楼的酒吧简单吃点。他们吃了点匹萨和鸡翅，LaNm要了一个汉堡。Iceiceice要了一个<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pork+belly+slider&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z5ybUr7QO9LdoAS2-ICYDQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1432&amp;bih=735">pork belly slider</a>，据他说很好吃。吃东西的时候MLG的Adam碰巧过来，我就给他们介绍了一下。他是个很棒的家伙，超级直接的那种。他确认了一下DK住的很舒服，并给我基本地讲了讲周末的事情。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　With stomachs filled, the team was ready to rest up. LaNm would room with BurNIng, and BurNIng jokingly asks LaNm if he snores. LaNm exclaims that, no, he doesn’t! Mushi and iceiceice are together, while MMY rooms with the manager Farseer. I update them on the schedule for the next day: venue opens at 10am, teams are free to enter at that time to practice on the many stations MLG had set up backstage, the event officially starts at 5pm, etc. MLG really had their bases covered regarding practice space for the teams - there was never a lack of stations for teams to warm up and watch replays on and players had full access to these stations during all hours of the event - well played.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　填饱肚子之后，队伍就准备睡觉了。LaNm和BurNIng住，BurNIng开玩笑问他打不打呼噜，LaNm叫道，不，我不打呼啊！Mushi和iceiceice住，MMY和经理Farseer住。我给他们讲了第二天的日程：赛场10点开（北京时间周六凌晨0点），到时队伍可以随意进去，可以在后台用MLG提供的电脑上练习，比赛下午是5点（北京时间周六上午7点），等等。MLG在保证队伍的训练方面做的很好--从未出现缺少电脑的情况，队伍可以热身，看replay，在任何时候可以在电脑上做任何事情--真nice。</p>

<h4>Friday Nov 22, 2013 | 2013年11月22日 星期五</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>　　Friday started off slowly as only half of DK had gotten up by the time I got down to the venue around 11am. The ones that had gotten down there, however, apparently had woken up at 6am - even after that late night and all the travel. I found LaNm, iceiceice, and BurNIng I think it was at the off-stage area. We were soon joined by Mushi and MMY, and the five of them had some fun playing a few pubs together. At lunchtime, we ventured over to the nearby North Market, where everyone got pho except iceiceice, who got Indian food. LaNm however became distracted by a Thai place and promised that he’d come get that next time… though there wasn’t another opportunity for him to do so over the weekend. As noon passed, they wanted to head back up to their rooms to rest a bit more, as most of them had woken up early due to jet lag and needed some more sleep. Unfortunately this meant that they missed their 4pm autograph session, but hopefully DK were generally available enough over the next few days for any fans to meet and greet with them. Around 5pm they came back down, bleary-eyed but with a bit more bounce in their step, and went back-stage to warm up prior to their on-stage matches against Alliance and Liquid. First they played a pub or two together, then did some analysis and discussion to their upcoming games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　周五开始得略迟缓，我11点（北京时间周六凌晨1点）下去赛场的时候DK只有一半的人起来了。但那几个已经在那儿的，都是6点（北京时间周五晚8点）就起来了的--尽管经历了长途旅行而且睡的很晚。我在副舞台区域找到了LaNm，iceiceice和BurNIng。很快Mushi和MMY也来了，他们五个打了几局路人。午饭时间，我们’勇敢地’冲到了附近的North Market，大家在那里吃了越南河粉，除了iceiceice，他吃了印度菜。而LaNm则被一家泰国餐馆分散了注意力，说是下次一定要去那里吃。。结果整个周末再也没有机会去吃了。午饭过后，他们想回房间再休息一下，因为大部分人都由于时差而起得很早。很不走运的是，这意味着他们错过了下午4点（北京时间周六早上6点）的签名活动，但好在在此之后DK基本上都能满足粉丝们的见面要求。大约5点（北京时间周六上午7点）他们下楼来，睡眼惺忪，但总归脚步更踏实了一点。到后台热身了一下，先是打了一两盘路人，然后分析讨论了一下即将开始的在主舞台对Alliance和Liquid的比赛。 </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FcRb2QZ.jpg" alt="Team DK backstage at MLG Columbus">

<blockquote>
<p>　　And then they were up on stage to play - Alliance, followed by Liquid. Honestly I hardly even remember these games themselves, but DK came out of the games 2-0 victors, showing impressive form. After the games, some passionate local Chinese fans (students from surrounding universities, mostly) came and offered to take us all out to eat. The offer seemed to be well-received by the Chinese contingent of DK, while iceiceice and Mushi apparently had been planning on going to get a burger nearby. Either way, everyone ended up piling onto a couple cars and off we went, about ten minutes away, to a Chinese restaurant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　然后就是主舞台的比赛--打Alliance，接着是Liquid。老实说我基本上记不得这两场比赛本身了，但是DK带回了2-0的胜利，展现出良好的状态。赛后，一些热情的当地中国粉丝（大部分是周边大学的留学生）过来说要请我们所有人吃饭。DK中国小分队很高兴地接受了邀请，而iceiceice和Mushi明显已经计划好在附近吃汉堡了。总之，大家伙儿被塞到了几辆车里，开了十分钟左右到了一家中餐馆。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　In the words of iceiceice, “I don’t like Chinese food, I don’t know why they come out here and still want to eat Chinese food.” It wasn’t too bad though, and when Mushi and iceiceice indicated that they wanted a bit of Peking roast duck, our gracious local hosts ordered an entire duck… By the time dinner was over, it was 11pm and at least BurNIng looked tired and ready to head back. Apparently the restaurant’s boss lady is a Dota fan as well, or at least feigned to look like she knew who DK were (maybe she just saw team uniforms and thought they must be important), so everyone gathered up to take a group picture at the end. The only one of these photos I have is the one where no one was looking at the camera…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　用iceiceice的话说，“我不喜欢中餐，我不懂为什么他们都到这里来了还想着吃中餐”。但其实这顿饭还不错，而且当Mushi和iceiceice提到他们想吃一点北京烤鸭的时候，我们和蔼可亲的当地主人点了一整只烤鸭。。。当晚饭结束，已经11点了（北京时间周六下午1点），至少BurNIng看起来很累，想回去休息了。显然，餐馆老板娘也是一个Dota粉丝，或者至少假装看起来知道DK是些什么人（也许她只是看到他们穿着队服，觉得他们应该是重要人物），所以大家被召集拍了一张合影。我这只有其中一张，没有一个人看着镜头。。。 </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4K9OPnx.jpg" alt="……">
　　…… <strong>……</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　It had gotten quite cold by nighttime, and BurNIng was shivering at the doorway of the restaurant as we left. I gave him a mini-hug to warm him up a little bit and he was like, “Aren’t you cold? Or you’ve gotten used to it…” Yeah, I guess the difference in weather from Shanghai to the American Midwest in winter is pretty drastic; in a lot of buildings in Shanghai they don’t even have heating, such are the mild winters. It had been snowing a little bit on and off that evening and night, and iceiceice was especially excited about it - he had never seen snow before in his life, this was his first time. So, in between shivering breaths, he’d be exclaiming how exciting it was, and asking whether his breath would frost up in the chilled air, and how he enjoys cold weather more than hot weather, because you can always put more clothes on, but can’t necessarily take more clothes off, and oh my goodness it’s so cold right now, and how he imagined snow might be fluffier…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　夜里很冷，BurNIng在酒店门口都有些打颤。我给他一个小拥抱暖暖身子，他的表情看上去好像在说“你都不冷么？还是说你已经习惯了。。。”是的，我猜上海和美国中西部的天气差别超级大；在上海的很多建筑里甚至没有暖气，可见冬天并不是特别残酷。当晚一直断断续续下着雪，iceiceice显得尤其激动--他人生当中还没有看到过雪，这是他的第一滴雪。所以在打颤的间隙，他一直在喊着他有多激动，问着他呼出来的气会不会在严寒里结成霜，表达着他有多喜欢冷天超过热天因为再冷你都可以加衣服但太热了也许没有衣服可脱，喊着’我的天哪真尼玛冷啊’，诉说着他以为雪会更加的蓬松。。。 </p>

<h4>Saturday Nov 23, 2013 | 2013年11月23日 星期六</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>　　DK’s next match would be their first off-stage match, against Fnatic. I had them down at the venue by around 10:30am so they could have some time to warm up and get used to the setting, and they had some fun playing more pubs together. They started their last pub pretty late before the 11:30am start time against Fnatic, with just around 20 minutes time. LaNm declared, “Pick fast push!” and off they went, with the likes of Shadow Shaman, Leshrac… for an <a href="http://dotabuff.com/matches/396737664">11 minute victory</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　DK下一场比赛是第一次在副舞台比赛，对阵Fnatic。我带他们在大约10:30（北京时间周日凌晨12点半）到赛场，这样他们有点时间热身和适应，他们又打了几盘路人。他们最后一盘路人开始得很迟，比赛是11:30（北京时间周日凌晨1:30）开始，他们只有20分钟了。LaNm宣布“打速推！”，于是他们选了暗影萨满，拉席克，等等，<a href="http://dotabuff.com/matches/396737664">大约用了11分钟取得了胜利</a>。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　The rest of the day, DK mostly cruised. Right before the DK and Navi went on stage, they were informed of the question that would be asked of each of them. Iceiceice and Puppey quickly decided that they would coordinate an answer between themselves, and hence came the hot chocolate answer. After their off-stage match against Sigma, they had around 2 hours for dinner or a break, or whatever. All of them except iceiceice chose to head up to their rooms to get some sleep, while iceiceice went with us to Five Guys at my suggestion, as he had been wanting a burger. It was snowing again as we made our way by car to the Five Guys a mile away, near Ohio State University campus. I ordered for iceiceice at his request, and got him a bacon cheeseburger with everything, plus extra mushrooms and onions, with A-1 sauce on top. “This is quite good,” he said through big mouthfuls. I’m glad you liked it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　当天剩下的比赛，DK波澜不惊。就在DK和Navi的比赛开始之前，他们被告知每个人将被问一个问题。Iceiceice和Puppey很快决定他们要协调一下答案，于是才出现了那个热巧克力回答。在他们副舞台和Sigma的比赛之后，他们有两个小时吃饭或休息或随便干嘛。所有人都回房睡觉，除了iceiceice，因为他想吃汉堡，所以我建议他跟着我们去了一英里以外，靠着OSU校园的Five Guys。我们开车去Five Guys的路上又在下雪。在他的要求下，我替iceiceice点了菜，给他叫了一个培根芝士汉堡，加了所有配料以及加量的蘑菇和洋葱，顶上涂了A-1酱。“这真好吃”，他嘴里塞满了东西说道。我很高兴你喜欢。 </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HE5Vb0H.jpg" alt="Iceiceice with Five Guys">
Iceiceice with Five Guys <strong>iceiceice和Five Guys</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　The light snow continued on our way back to the hotel. “Snow makes everything look nicer,” iceiceice remarked. Yeah, it does. But it was still cold, and iceiceice quickly forgot about his plans to make frosty clouds of air with his breath outside as we rushed back inside the hotel from the car. For the remaining hour, he went up to his room to relax for a bit as well, and so I waited downstairs for the rest of the players to appear at 8pm, half an hour before their scheduled match against Pretty Boy Swag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　回酒店的路上还是有小雪。“雪让所有东西看起来都更好了”，iceiceice评价道。是的，确实是。但是还是很冷的，我们急着冲回酒店，iceiceice很快忘记了他想用呼出来的气制造霜雾的计划。剩下的一小时他上楼回房放松一下，我在楼下等着队员们8点（北京时间周日上午10点）出现，按计划到时还有半小时他们就要打PBS了。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　Mushi came down first, followed by MMY, but then the rest of them were nowhere to be seen. 8:15 went by, then 8:20, then 8:25. By then I’d knocked on their doors and had begun calling their rooms. Sleepy voices echoed out from the other end of the phone, at least alleviating my fears that they’d somehow gone out and gotten lost somewhere. Instead in its place was a mystifying wait, as it was only 15 minutes later that iceiceice finally appeared downstairs, by which time it was already 8:40. So I went to room 520, where BurNIng and LaNm were staying, and knocked on their door - LaNm came to the door, putting on his jacket, and BurNIng was just climbing out of bed. He looked groggily to me, “We’re late, aren’t we?” I looked back at him… “Yeah, yeah you’re late,” with an exasperated but amused feeling inside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　Mushi第一个下楼，接着是MMY，但是其他人完全看不到。8:15过去了，8:20过去了，然后是8:25。此时我已经敲了他们的门，开始打电话叫他们了。带着睡意的声音从电话那头传来，至少消除了我对他们出去玩走丢了的担忧。在困惑地等了15分钟之后，iceiceice终于出现了，此时已经是8:40。所以我们去了520房间敲门，这是BurNIng和LaNm住的房间。LaNm来开的门，正在穿夹克，而BurNIng还正在从床上爬起来。他看起来累得东倒西歪（用术语说就是‘醉了’）“我们迟到了，是不？”我看看他。。“是的，你们迟到了”我有些恼火，也有些好笑。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　BurNIng gets up, puts his shoes on, and looks at his phone and bursts out laughing. “I know why we never woke up!” he looks around at LaNm and me, “It’s because I set the alarm for 8 in the morning, when it should’ve been for night.” I laughed, LaNm laughed… Yeah, that’ll do it… that’ll make you late indeed. We rushed down to the venue, a mere 25 minutes late for Pretty Boy Swag. DK was clearly still tired, as their play and drafts were sloppy in both games against PBS and later Speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　BurNIng起床了，穿上鞋，看看他的手机然后突然大笑起来。“我知道为什么我们没起来了！”他看看LaNm和我，“因为我把闹钟设成早上8点了，应该是晚上8点的”我笑了，LaNm也笑了。。。是的，这样。。确实。。会。。让你迟到。我们冲下楼到赛场，大约迟到了25分钟。DK很显然依然很累，他们和PBS以及Speed的两场比赛都BP很烂，打的也烂。 </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/E5guxQB.jpg" alt="DK drafting in an off-stage match">

<blockquote>
<p>　　Afterwards, we discussed with MLG briefly the logistics of the next day’s semifinals matches, upon which DK eventually decided on playing second, and they went back up to work together on discussing their next challenge against NaVi. BurNIng started discussions that night by saying to his team, “This is one of our great opportunities to win a title… we’ve come so far already…” Even though they were fine with me being there, I didn’t want to intrude any further, and after helping them get a late dinner, I said my goodnights, made sure they knew their schedule for the next day, and left them to their preparations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　之后，我们与MLG简短地讨论了一下第二天半决赛的安排，DK最终决定第二场打，然后他们回去讨论了怎么打NaVi。BurNIng开始讨论的时候对队友说，“这是我们最好的夺冠机会。。。我们已经走了这么远。。。”尽管我在那里他们也不觉得有什么，我还是不想再打扰他们，帮他们弄了一份夜宵之后，我说了晚安，确保他们知道明天的赛程之后，离开了他们。</p>

<h4>Sunday Nov 24, 2013 | 2013年11月24日 星期日</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>　　The next morning, iceiceice, BurNIng, and LaNm were up bright and early as I found them around 9:30am finishing up breakfast at the restaurant on the second floor. After breakfast, BurNIng went back up to get some more sleep, and iceiceice, LaNm and I headed to the venue. We went backstage, and LaNm excitedly exclaimed, “Time to pub!!” I love playing pubs!” and then invited me to play with the two of them. That was pretty fun. During one of the pub games, the other team was convinced they were fakes, but by the end, were wishing DK luck at MLG.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　第二天早上，iceiceice，BurNIng和LaNm起的很早很愉快，我9:30（北京时间周日晚上11:30）发现他们在二楼餐厅，快吃完早饭了。早饭后BurNIng又上楼补觉去了，iceiceice，LaNm和我一起去赛场。我们去了后台，LaNm很兴奋，“路人时间到！我爱打(虐)路人！”，然后邀请我跟他们两个一起玩。很有趣。其中一场路人局中，我们一度让对面相信DK的ID是假冒的，但是在最后，对面还是祝福了DK在MLG好运。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　A bit later, MMY, BurNIng, and Mushi showed up, and DK gathered to do some last minute analysis and whatnot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　稍晚一些，MMY，BurNIng和Mushi出现，DK聚在一起最后分析了一下。 </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tIAReG8.jpg" alt="DK preparing before MLG semifinals against NaVi">
DK preparing before MLG semifinals against NaVi. <strong>DK在准备与NaVi的半决赛</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　With about an hour to go before their semifinals match against NaVi, NaVi themselves showed up, and the two teams hung out a bit backstage. Iceiceice challenged Kuroky to an arm-wrestling match, and upon beginning the match, iceiceice immediately took both hands to KKY’s one hand, ‘won’ the match illegitimately, and raised his arms in triumph while Kuroky looked on with a mixture of bemusement and non-acceptance of having just lost the arm wrestling match. The rest of the time went similarly lightheartedly, with chattering and trolling and joking amongst the two teams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　在半决赛打NaVi之前一小时左右，NaVi出现了，两队互相寒暄了几句。Iceiceice向Kuroky挑战扳手腕，并且在比赛刚刚开始的时候立刻用两只手抓住了KKY的一只手，不正当地赢了比赛，然后举起手臂作出胜利的姿态，留下Kuroky一人带着复杂的表情，夹杂着对自己输了一场扳手腕比赛的困惑和无法接受。剩下的时间也同样的轻松自在，两支队伍唠叨唠叨，互相钓钓鱼开开玩笑神马的。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　I think it was before the NaVi match here that Mushi ended up being the one who had an on-stage question directed at him, thanks to iceiceice volunteering him for it while Mushi was in the bathroom. Mushi came back, heard that he was going to be questioned, and immediately shrank back trying to decline. In the end, I coached him on his answer a little bit after Mushi kicked iceiceice for signing him up in absentia, and Mushi went on-stage with his answers ready.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　我记得貌似是和NaVi比赛前，Mushi成为了那个会在舞台上被提问的人。感谢iceiceice在Mushi去厕所的时候替他答应。Mushi回来以后听说他要被问问题，立刻向后缩，想拒绝。（画外音：你们不要再采访我大Mushi和MMY了好么。。）最终，在Mushi’痛扁’了iceiceice之后我教了他一下回答，Mushi带着准备好的答案出了场。</p>

<p>　　Then came the semifinals match. The actual games were a blur in my mind, but DK ended up with the win after a game 3 in which BurNIng, perhaps uncharacteristically, took the risk of building a Divine Rapier when he wasn’t absolutely pressed to do so (in fact, not at all needed).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　接下来就是半决赛。实际比赛在我脑中已经模糊，但是DK最终拿下了这场BO3。在最后一场BurNing，一反常态地，冒险出了一把圣剑，而当时并没有被逼到一定要这么做（事实上，一点也没有必要） </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　Of course, his Rapier came after they lost a close game against NaVi in game two, where XBOCT built a dominating two Divine Rapiers. After game three ended with a Rapier of his own, BurNIng then said something I’ll never forget:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　当然，他的圣剑是因为DK在第二场很胶着的比赛中由于XBOCT专横地出了两把圣剑而输掉了比赛。在第三场比赛带着自己的圣剑取得胜利后，BurNIng说了一句我永远不会忘记的话： </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　“不出圣剑怎么对得起我们的粉丝”</p>

<p>　　“How am I worthy of our fans if I don’t build Rapier there?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　“不出圣剑怎么对得起我们的粉丝”（原文用的中文，非英文转译） </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　Throughout the weekend, DK were regularly mobbed by fans looking to get pictures and autographs, perhaps because DK were unable to make their session. Hopefully they were available enough throughout the event to make up for their absence at the session. On finals day, they had far less time to pause for signings and photos, and even still, they tried their best and often I had to play the bad guy to ‘drag’ them out of a crowd of fans in order to keep them on schedule. Hopefully no one was let down, and hopefully everyone understands the scheduling… BurNIng always had a conflicted look on his face whenever he had to decline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　在整个周末，DK定期被粉丝群包围，试图合影要签名，可能也是因为DK之前没有出席他们的签名活动。但愿他们在整个赛事期间做出了足够的弥补。在决赛日，他们几乎没有时间停下来签名和拍照，但他们仍然尽力去做到最好。很多时候我得做那个’坏人’去把他们从人堆里拉出来，以便他们能跟上进度。希望大家能理解赛程紧张。。。每当不得不拒绝粉丝的时候，BurNIng总是显得很矛盾。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　And then, without much downtime at all due to scheduling delays, DK were up to play against Speed.int in the Finals of MLG Columbus. They’d come so far, and perhaps this was the closest any of them had been to a title in recent times. It was Mushi’s first final ever, in fact. DK won game one after a gruelling back and forth battle, with LaNm carrying the team on his spectacular Earthshaker play. After that game, backstage, LaNm was exhausted. He looked like he’d run a marathon, and indeed, he probably did the mental equivalent. By this time, DK hadn’t eaten since breakfast around 10am. A lot of players prefer not to eat full meals within a reasonable time of a competitive game, so you can imagine just why guys like LaNm are so skinny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　由于赛程被耽误了，并没有太多停工时间，DK就要开始和Speed的决赛。他们已经走过了这么远，这次也许是他们所有人近期内离冠军最近的一次。事实上这是Mushi有史以来第一次决赛。在经历了一局折磨人的有来有回的战役之后，DK赢了第一局。LaNm用他令人惊叹的撼地者表演carry了全队。赛后，在后台，LaNm精疲力尽。他看上去像刚跑完一场马拉松，事实上，从精神上来说，他确实刚跑完一场马拉松。从早上10点（北京时间周一凌晨0点）到这个时候，DK还没有吃过东西。很多选手喜欢在比赛期间不吃正餐，所以你可以想象为什么像LaNm的选手这么瘦。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　One more win, one step away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　再赢一场，一步之遥 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　In the end, DK faltered. LaNm was practically asleep during the game 2 draft, and from a casual fan’s point of view (my point of view, that is), his seating in the center of DK’s five isn’t a coincidence. He’s the beat of the team, the rhythm-keeper, and when he’s tired, the team feels it. (For those that are curious about DK playing the second semifinals, refer to this reddit post to learn more) Some of the drafts were questionable too, perhaps another result of the team, and BurNIng, being really tired. After the loss, Mushi sat quietly for a bit, the rest went without talking, and then they waited for each other to head back to the hotel together. It was nearly midnight already, and MMY, BurNIng, and LaNm all went up pretty quickly and fell asleep. Mushi came back down after a while, he and iceiceice hung out with us on the second floor lobby. We ordered some pizza and pasta delivered and the two of them, with me and my girlfriend, we four sat peacefully, eating and chatting into the night until about 2:30am.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　可惜最终，DK陨落。LaNm实际上在第二场BP的时候已经睡着了。从一个休闲粉丝的角度（我的角度）来看，他坐在DK的中间位置并非偶然。他是这支队伍的拍子，是保持节奏的点，当他太累了，队伍也都会感觉到。（对于DK把半决赛放在第二场打感到好奇的人们，看附在最后的reddit帖子了解更多内幕）此外一些BP也很有问题，这有可能也是整支队伍，尤其是BurNIng真的很疲劳导致的。在输了比赛之后，Mushi静静地说了点什么，其他人一言不发。然后他们一起回酒店。当时已经是午夜，MMY，BurNIng和LaNm很快就睡着了。过了一会儿，Mushi又下楼来，他和iceiceice跟我们一起在二楼大厅待了一会儿。我们点了一些匹萨和意大利面，他们两个和我还有我女朋友，我们四个人静静地坐在一起，吃东西，聊聊，一直到夜里2:30（北京时间周一下午4:30）左右。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　BurNIng, MMY, and LaNm were to leave at 6am in the morning for their flight back to China and I was to go with them to make sure everything went smoothly. Originally iceiceice and Mushi were supposed to come along too, but their flight being only at 11am, they decided to head to the airport later. At nearly 3am, we all headed back up to our respective rooms, said our goodbyes. A few minutes later, iceiceice messages on Wechat (instant messaging service) asking what room I’m in… and appears at the door in his boxers. He insists on giving me the stuff from the bag that MLG gave to each player - a Steelseries mouse and mousepad, and a Turtle Beach headset. So right now I have in my possession the headset that iceiceice used live in his off-stage games at MLG. o_O. Thanks ice. Then we say what we think are our last farewells for the weekend… Hotel fire alarm goes off ten minutes later, and we see iceiceice and Mushi again in the lobby. Evidently, the rest of DK has slept through the alarm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　BurNIng，MMY和LaNm要坐早上6点（北京时间周一晚上8点）的飞机回国，我得和他们一起去机场以确保事情都顺利。本来iceiceice和Mushi也要一起去的，但是他们的飞机11点（北京时间周二凌晨1点）才飞，他们决定迟点去机场。大约3点的时候（北京时间周一下午5点），我们告了别，回了各自房间。几分钟以后，iceiceice用微信联系我问我在哪个房间。。然后穿着四角内裤出现在门口。他坚持要把MLG给每位选手发的东西给我--一个Steelseries鼠标和鼠标垫，一个Turtle Beach头戴式耳机。所以现在我手上有iceiceice在MLG副舞台比赛时用过的耳机。o_O。感谢表弟。然后我们互相告别，以为这是我们最后的告别。。。十分钟后酒店的火警突然响了，我们在大堂又见到了iceiceice和Mushi。显而易见，DK的其他人都睡过去了。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　Sometime during the night, we ran into Dendi. He offered a photo op with him, but then added on that it would be ten dollars. Instead, I offered him the photo op with myself, he accepted, and thus I got a free photo. And he gave me a hug too. That made me feel better about the finals that had just ended… Thanks Dendi, you’re cool. I’ll see you next time too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　夜里的某个时候，我遇到了Dendi。他为我提供了一个与他合影的机会，但是要收10刀。而我为他提供了一个和我合影的机会，他接受了，于是我获得了一张免费合影。他还拥抱了我，让我在决赛之后感到了好受一下。。感谢Denti，你太酷了。下次见了。 </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/g48K2mh.jpg" alt="Hello Dendi.">
Hello Dendi. <strong>你好Dendi</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　In the morning, BurNIng and LaNm are downstairs and checked out on time, and after a slight delay, we have the others who are leaving on the morning flight. Spirits seem to be as high as they can be after losing a major final… or perhaps it just hasn’t sunk in yet. I know it hasn’t for me yet at that point. They’re discussing loudly - boisterously, even, what went right and what went wrong for them the previous night. LaNm is confident in what he says, MMY often offers a different perspective, while BurNIng sometimes agrees, and sometimes disagrees with the both of them. I go with them through security check, and after half an hour in which they never stop discussing, their boarding call is heard, and I herd them over to their boarding gate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　早上，BurNIng和LaNm准点下楼退房。短暂延误之后其他早班飞机乘员也来了。以刚输了一场大赛的决赛来看，他们的精神看起来很不错了。。又或者只是低落的情绪还没有来袭。我知道我自己当时还没开始有低落的情绪。他们热烈地讨论，甚至有点吵闹，讨论昨晚的比赛哪些是对的，哪些是错的。LaNm对自己的观点很有信心，MMY常常提出不同的观点，而BurNIng有时候同意，有时候对他们俩都不同意。我陪他们过了安检，他们又不停地讨论了半小时，终于要登机了，我带他们到了登机口。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　MMY smiles wanly before quickly turning away, the manager nods in appreciation, LaNm waves and simply says “See you next time”. BurNIng lingers a little bit, turns to me, smiles, and says “Give me a hug!” And then DK was gone, as quickly as they’d come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　MMY 弱弱地笑了一下，很快地转身而去，经理点头以示感谢，LaNm挥了挥手简单地说道“下次再见”。BurNing徘徊了一下，转向我笑笑，说“给我一个拥抱！”然后DK就匆匆地走了，正如他们匆匆地来。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　Perhaps it didn’t sink in for them until they got back. It didn’t sink in for me until the trip home. I only then realized that I had so wanted to be able to send them home that day with the trophy, with a major tournament title. I’m sure they wanted it way more than I ever could have imagined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　也许他们回去以后才会进入低落的情绪。我在回家的路上才感到心情开始低落。知道那时我才意识到我有多么希望能够送他们带着奖杯回家，带着重大赛事的冠军头衔回家。我知道他们比我能想象的更加希望。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　All credit to Kaipi/Speed, they played to their style and didn’t let anyone or any external factor (of which there were many - all the more impressive for them) stop them, and that’s what winning is about. As for DK, MLG Columbus weekend has given me an unimaginable chance to be close to them, get to know them, and perhaps even help them. I can only thank MLG and Adam for the opportunity, and my respect and liking for DK and each of their players has only increased, if that was possible at all. DK - BurNIng, LaNm, Mushi, MMY, iceiceice… you guys are great.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　所有的荣誉归于KaiPi/Speed，他们打出了风格，并未让任何人或任何外部因素（有很多外部因素在那儿盯着）阻止他们，这才是真正的胜利。至于DK，MLG Columbus周末已经带给我机会在想象不到的近距离接触他们，了解他们，甚至帮助他们。我只能谢谢MLG和Adam给我这次机会，我对DK和DK每一位队员的尊敬和喜爱又增加了，如果还能增加的话。DK--B神，国土，大Mushi，毛毛鸭，三冰。。。你们都太棒了！ </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　谢谢你们所有人。 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　<em>shout outs to Cyborgmatt, Xixi, LD, Vykromond, Lumi, DPM, Godz, Merlini, Tangeng, Sun-Tzu, Dendi, Valve Chris, Valve Phil and family, and anyone else I missed but enjoyed the company of, for being fun to chat or hang out with at various times during the weekend. You all helped me keep my sanity while I went through with ~14 hours sleep over 4 days.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>最后附上原文中提到的reddit帖子原文和翻译：</p>

<blockquote>
<p>　　I can hopefully address this in its entirety.</p>

<p>　　DK were asked late (late, as in after the last group stage match) on Saturday night if they&#39;d prefer playing first or second on Sunday. After some brief deliberations, DK decided second would be slightly better. Their reasoning was as follows (in no particular order of importance): They&#39;d been tired as hell, and the potential extra rest in the morning would be very welcome. Between NaVi and Speed/Sigma, NaVi are 3-time TI finalists and having the extra time to prepare for NaVi, on paper, might&#39;ve been the marginally better choice -- having some extra time in the morning meant they could either stay up later discussing (which they did), and get up earlier to warm up/prepare (which they also did) while also catching up on some rest.</p>

<p>　　Unfortunately that resulted in DK needing to play every single one of their matches on Sunday back-to-back with almost zero downtime due to delays that snowballed from before they even went on stage for the first time. And they didn&#39;t get to eat or rest from roughly 10am until 11pm as a result.</p>

<p>　　For the sake of &#39;addressing in entirety&#39; I&#39;ll add my own opinion as well (please note this part is purely my own opinion as a fan, and I am not speaking for anyone but myself, as a fan and viewer): IMO, yes the fatigue affected them. If you look at their last two group stage matches, they were similarly tired after a similarly long day of matches, and their play was similarly sloppy compared to their nearly-pristine performances against the likes of Alliance or NaVi. The last two group stage matches and the last two finals matches both came around the same time in the night -- the combination of long days and jet lag did add up and take its toll around the same time both nights. The long, gruelling games on Sunday just drained them even more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>　　我也许能整体上说明一下这个问题。</p>

<p>　　DK在周六晚上很晚（最后一场小组赛之后）的时候被问道他们想周日的时候先比半决赛还是后比。考虑了一会儿以后，DK决定第二个打会更好。他们的理由如下（未按重要性排序）：他们当时累成狗了，早上多睡一会儿比较好；在NaVi和Speed/Sigma中，NaVi进了三界TI决赛，如果有更多的时候为和NaVi的比赛作准备，或许会略微好一点--早上时间更充足意味着要么晚上可以讨论到迟一点（他们确实这么做了），或者早一点起来热身/准备（他们也确实这么做了），与此同时，还能稍微多睡一会儿。</p>

<p>　　不幸的是，这样做的结果是DK周日的每一场比赛都成了背靠背的比赛，由于早在第一场比赛之前就开始滚雪球的赛程延误，DK每场比赛中间几乎没有任何休息时间。他们从早上10点到晚上11点就没有吃过东西或者休息过。</p>

<p>　　为了从‘整体上说明一下’，我再说一下个人观点（请注意这一段完全是我作为粉丝的个人观点，不代表任何人只代表我自己，一个粉丝及现场观众）：以我来看，是的，疲劳影响了他们。如果你看了小组赛最后两场，经历了一整天比赛，他们当时（和周日晚上）差不多累，相对之前同诸如Alliance和NaVi的比赛来看，打的也差不多烂。小组赛最后两场和决赛最后两场在晚上差不多的时间进行--漫长的一天加上时差联合起来在同一时间对选手造成了损害。周日的前四场繁重累人的比赛也更多地耗尽了他们。</p>
