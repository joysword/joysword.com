<h3><font size="5">Improved Microwave Design</font></h3>
<div>
<p><font size="4">The image to the left is our group approved microwave design. To simplify the design we removed many of the specific function buttons for food and beverages. In general we decided to put the most commonly used function at the top and least used functions at the bottom. This excludes the start and stop buttons which are highlighted at the bottom with red and green highlights.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Starting from the top we have the LED for the time of day, microwave timer, and kitchen timer that does not turn on the microwave. Next to that we placed the set clock and set timer buttons since their functions directly relate to the LED panel.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Below the LED we placed the what we think is the most commonly used buttons, add minute, add 30 seconds, and add 15 seconds. All three buttons would auto start the microwave. They can be pressed while the microwave is on. If the user needs to set a more specific time they can just start typing on the keypad and then hit start. For ease of use, a back button has been implemented so you don't have to clear the entire panel if a wrong digit is typed in.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The final row before the start and stop button is the power level. Arrow buttons facing left and right control the level. The blue to red LED's would light up based on the current power level. Red being the highest power level and blue being the lowest.</font></p>
