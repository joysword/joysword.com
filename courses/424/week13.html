    <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">"Visual Analytics is the science of
        analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual
        interfaces. People use visual analytics tools and techniques to
        synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic,
        ambiguous, and often conflicting data, provide timely,
        defensible, and understandable assessments; and communicate
        assessment effectively for action. The overall goal is to detect
        the expected and discover the unexpected. "<br>
        <br>
        The goal of visual analytics is to facilitate this analytical
        reasoning process through the creation of software that
        maximizes human capacity to perceive, understand, and reason
        about complex and dynamic data and situations.<br>
        <br>
        It must build upon an understanding of the reasoning process, as
        well as an understanding of underlying cognitive and perceptual
        principles, to provide mission-appropriate interactions that
        allow analysts to have a true discourse with their information.
        The goal is to facilitate high-quality human judgment with a
        limited investment of the analysts&#8217; time.<br>

        Visual analytics is a multidisciplinary field that includes the
        following focus areas:<br>

              style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Data
representations



              and transformations</span> that convert all types of
            conflicting and dynamic data in ways that support
            visualization and analysis</span><span style="font-family:

              and interaction techniques</span> that take advantage of
            the human eye&#8217;s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to
            allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of
            information at once</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><span

reasoning



              techniques</span> that enable users to obtain deep
            insights that directly support assessment, planning, and
            decision making</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
              style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Techniques



              to support production, presentation, and dissemination</span><span

              results of an analysis to communicate</span></span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">An analysis
        session is a <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:
          underline;">dialogue</span> between the analyst and the data
        where the visual representation is the interface into the data.
      </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The use of
        visual representations and interactions to accelerate rapid
        insight into complex data is what distinguishes visual analytics
        software from other types of analytical tools. Visual
        representations translate data into a visible form that
        highlights important features, including commonalities and
        anomalies. These visual representations make it easy for users
        to perceive salient aspects of their data quickly. Augmenting
        the cognitive reasoning process with perceptual reasoning
        through visual representations permits the analytical reasoning
        process to become faster and more focused.</span><br
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Visual
        representations invite the user to explore his or her data. This
        exploration requires that the user be able to interact with the
        data to understand trends and anomalies, isolate and reorganize
        information as appropriate, and engage in the analytical
        reasoning process. It is through these interactions that the
        analyst achieves insight.<br>

        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Analysts
        may be asked to perform several different types of tasks:</span><br

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
        Steps in the Analytical Process<br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Determine
how



            to address the issue that has been posed, what resources to
            use, and how to allocate time to various parts of the
            process to meet deadlines. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Gather
information



            containing the relevant evidence and become familiar with
            it, and incorporate it with the knowledge he or she already
            has. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Generate
multiple



            candidate hypotheses. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Evaluate
these



            alternative explanations in light of evidence and
            assumptions to reach a judgment about the most likely
            explanations or outcomes. </span></li>
        <li style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Consider
          alternative explanations that were not previously considered.</li>
        <li style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Create
          reports, presentations, or other products that summarize the
          analytical judgments. These products summarize the judgments
          made and the supporting reasoning that was developed, and the
          uncertainties that remain during the analytical process. These
          products can then be shared with others.<br>

    <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;

    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Its very
        important to quickly identify competing explanations and chains
        of reasoning for the issue under study and actively maintain
        awareness of those competing idea so that they are kept &#8220;alive&#8221;</span><span

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Often the
        most plausible explanation will be researched extensively,
        analysts should always revisit the key alternatives. </span><span
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Visual
        analytics tools must facilitate the analyst&#8217;s task of actively
        considering competing hypotheses.</span><br style="font-family:

      <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Another
        important analytic technique is the enumeration and testing of
        assumptions.</span><span style="font-family:

            told them they couldn&#8217;t make that recommendation. They had
            to give us a temperature that we could launch with.&#8217;<br>
            <br>
            A formal presentation would have to be made, two hours after
            speaking with Lovingood and just 15 hours before launch, via
            a teleconference at which Thiokol would need to given their
            reasoning for a no launch decision &#8211; a power contractors

            at what we&#8217;d present to NASA,&#8217; noted Boisjoly. &#8216;I had no

            recommended no launch,&#8217; remembered Ebeling, as they
            recommended a minimum launch temperature of 53F (11C). The
            expected rubber stamping of that recommendation was expected
            from NASA on the other end of the teleconference. However,
            they would be proven wrong.<br>

            worked through to create a less flawed design, so NASA knew
            there were continuing concerns, but the amount of data
            available from the 24 previous shuttle flights was limited.
            For example the Morton Thiokol engineers did not have
            temperature data available for all of the previous shuttle
            flights (air temperature, or the much more useful O-ring
            temperature.) Seven earlier flights had O-ring issues, and
            those launches were at temperatures (F) of 53, 57, 58, 63,
            70, 70, 75, and only two of those had serious 'blow by'
            issues, one at 53F and one at 75F. There were problems when
            it was warm; there were problems when it was cool. No

        A well structured and managed system emphasizing safety would
        have flagged the rising doubts about the Solid Rocket Booster
        joint seal. Had these matters been clearly stated and emphasized
        in the flight readiness process in terms reflecting the views of
        most of the Thiokol engineers and at least some of the Marshall
        engineers, it seems likely that the launch of 51-L might not
        have occurred when it did.<br>
        <br>
        4. The Commission concluded that the Thiokol Management reversed
        its position and recommended the launch of 51-L, at the urging
        of Marshall and contrary to the views of its engineers in order
        to accommodate a major customer.<br>

        Even after the disaster and the during the investigation when
        there was more time and more information available bad graphics
        were still being created. Looking at the O-Ring damage over the
        previous 24 shuttle missions, the data was presented in
        chronological order showing the location and extent of the
        damage sustained to the left and right boosters and the
        temperature at launch time. This hides the pattern.</span>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:

          of Columbia disaster in 2003 with refs from Tufte's "Beautiful
          Evidence" - how you organize, present text, and choose words
          can be just as dangerous as how you present graphical
          information. Do all of the necessary words even fit readably
          on a PowerPoint slide?<br>
          <br>
          Unlike Challenger, this time the issue was less about what the
          engineers knew and more about what they did not know and their
          inability to convince their managers to get them more
          information from the astronauts in space or department of
          defense imagery.<br>

        which we will hit the highlights of ...<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"Columbia was launched from Launch Com- plex 39-A on
        January 16, 2003, at 10:39 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST). At
        81.7 seconds after launch, when the Shuttle was at about 65,820
        feet and traveling at Mach 2.46 (1,650 mph), a large piece of
        hand-crafted insulating foam came off an area where the Orbiter
        attaches to the External Tank. At 81.9 seconds, it struck the
        leading edge of Columbia&#700;s left wing. This event was not
        detected by the crew on board or seen by ground support teams
        until the next day, during detailed reviews of all launch camera
        photography and videos. This foam strike had no apparent effect
        on the daily conduct of the 16-day mission, which met all its
        objectives."<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"Post-launch photographic analysis showed that one
        large piece and at least two smaller pieces of insulating foam
        separated from the External Tank left bipod (&#8211;Y) ramp area at
        81.7 seconds after launch. Later analysis showed that the larger
        piece struck Columbia on the underside of the left wing, around
        Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels 5 through 9, at 81.9
        seconds after launch (see Figure 2.3-2). Further photographic
        analysis conducted the day after launch revealed that the large
        foam piece was approximately 21 to 27 inches long and 12 to 18
        inches wide, tumbling at a minimum of 18 times per second, and
        moving at a relative velocity to the Shuttle Stack of 625 to 840
        feet per second (416 to 573 miles per hour) at the time of
        impact."<br>

      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"The object&#700;s large size and the apparent momentum
        transfer concerned Intercenter Photo Working Group personnel,
        who were worried that Columbia had sustained damage not
        detectable in the limited number of views their tracking cameras
        captured. This concern led the Intercenter Photo Working Group
        Chair to request, in anticipation of analysts&#700; needs, that a
        high-resolution image of the Orbiter on-orbit be obtained by the
        Department of Defense. By the Board&#700;s count, this would be the
        first of three distinct requests to image Columbia on-orbit. The
        exact chain of events and circumstances surrounding the movement
        of each of these requests through Shuttle Program Management, as
        well as the ultimate denial of these requests, is a topic of
        Chapter 6."<br>

        Assessment Team was restricted to using a mathematical modeling
        tool called Crater to assess damage, although it had not been
        designed with this type of impact in mind. Team members
        concluded over the next six days that some localized heating
        damage would most likely occur during re-entry, but they could
        not definitively state that structural damage would result. On
        January 24, the Debris Assessment Team made a presentation of
        these results to the Mission Evaluation Room, whose manager gave
        a verbal summary (with no data) of that presentation to the
        Mission Management Team the same day. The Mission Management
        Team declared the debris strike a &#8220;turnaround&#8221; issue and did not
        pursue a request for imagery."<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"Boeing analysts conducted a preliminary damage
        assessment on Saturday. Using video and photo images, they
        generated two estimates of possible debris size &#8211; 20 inches by
        20 inches by 2 inches, and 20 inches by 16 inches by 6 inches &#8211;
        and determined that the debris was traveling at a approximately
        750 feet per second, or 511 miles per hour, when it struck the
        Orbiter at an estimated impact angle of less than 20 degrees.
        These estimates later proved remarkably accurate."<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"To calculate the damage that might result from such a
        strike, the analysts turned to a Boeing mathematical modeling
        tool called Crater that uses a specially developed algorithm to
        predict the depth of a Thermal Protection System tile to which
        debris will penetrate. This algorithm, suitable for estimating
        small (on the order of three cubic inches) debris impacts, had
        been calibrated by the results of foam, ice, and metal debris
        impact testing. "<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"Until STS-107, Crater was normally used only to
        predict whether small debris, usually ice on the External Tank,
        would pose a threat to the Orbiter during launch. Engineers used
        Crater during STS-107 to analyze a piece of debris that was at
        maximum 640 times larger in volume than the pieces of debris
        used to calibrate and validate the Crater model (the Board&#700;s
        best estimate is that it actually was 400 times larger)."</p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"For the Thermal Protection System tile, Crater
        predicted damage deeper than the actual tile thickness. This
        seemingly alarming result suggested that the debris that struck
        Columbia would have exposed the Orbiter&#700;s underlying aluminum
        airframe to extreme temperatures, resulting in a possible
        burn-through during re-entry. Debris Assessment Team engineers
        discounted the possibility of burn through for two reasons.
        First, the results of calibration tests with small projectiles
        showed that Crater predicted a deeper penetration than would
        actually occur. Second, the Crater equation does not take into
        account the increased density of a tile&#700;s lower &#8220;densified&#8221;
        layer, which is much stronger than tile&#700;s fragile outer layer.
        Therefore, engineers judged that the actual damage from the
        large piece of foam lost on STS-107 would not be as severe as
        Crater predicted, and assumed that the debris did not penetrate
        the Orbiter&#700;s skin."<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"Prior to STS-107, Crater analysis was the
        responsibility of a team at Boeing&#700;s Huntington Beach facility
        in California, but this responsibility had recently been
        transferred to Boeing&#700;s Houston office. Even though STS-107&#700;s
        debris strike was 400 times larger than the objects Crater is
        designed to model, neither Johnson engineers nor Program
        managers appealed for assistance from the more experienced
        Huntington Beach engineers, who might have cautioned against
        using Crater so far outside its validated limits. Nor did safety
        personnel provide any additional oversight. NASA failed to
        connect the dots: the engineers who misinterpreted Crater &#8211; a
        tool already unsuited to the task at hand &#8211; were the very ones
        the Shuttle Program identified as engendering the most risk in
        their transition from Huntington Beach." </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"Columbia re-entered Earth&#700;s atmosphere with a
        pre-existing breach in the leading edge of its left wing in the
        vicinity of Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panel 8. This breach,
        caused by the foam strike on ascent, was of sufficient size to
        allow superheated air (probably exceeding 5,000 degrees
        Fahrenheit) to penetrate the cavity behind the RCC panel. The
        breach widened, destroying the insulation protecting the wing&#700;s
        leading edge support structure, and the superheated air
        eventually melted the thin aluminum wing spar. Once in the
        interior, the superheated air began to destroy the left wing."</p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"By the time Columbia passed over the coast of
        California in the pre-dawn hours of February 1, at Entry
        Interface plus 555 seconds, amateur videos show that pieces of
        the Orbiter were shedding. Analysis indicates that the Orbiter
        continued to fly its pre-planned flight profile, although, still
        unknown to anyone on the ground or aboard Columbia, her control
        systems were working furiously to maintain that flight profile.
        Finally, over Texas, just southwest of Dallas-Fort Worth, the
        increasing aerodynamic forces the Orbiter experienced in the
        denser levels of the atmosphere overcame the catastrophically
        damaged left wing, causing the Orbiter to fall out of control at
        speeds in excess of 10,000 mph."<br>

        and for a bit of perspective:<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">One debris strike in particular foreshadows the
        STS-107 event. When Atlantis was launched on STS-27R on December
        2, 1988, the largest debris event up to that time significantly
        damaged the Orbiter. Post-launch analysis of tracking camera
        imagery by the Intercenter Photo Working Group identified a
        large piece of debris that struck the Thermal Protection System
        tile at approximately 85 seconds into the flight. On Flight Day
        Two, Mission Control asked the flight crew to inspect Atlantis
        with a camera mounted on the remote manipulator arm, a robotic
        device that was not installed on Columbia for STS-107. Mission
        Commander R.L. &#8220;Hoot&#8221; Gibson later stated that Atlantis &#8220;looked
        like it had been blasted by a shotgun.&#8221;18 Concerned that the
        Orbiter&#700;s Thermal Protection System had been breached, Gibson
        ordered that the video be transferred to Mission Control so that
        NASA engineers could evaluate the damage.</p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:

        extent of the damage. Post-mission inspections deemed it &#8220;the
        most severe of any mission yet flown.&#8221; The Orbiter had 707
        dings, 298 of which were greater than an inch in one dimension.

      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"As information gets passed up an organization
        hierarchy, from people who do analysis to mid-level managers to
        high-level leadership, key explanations and supporting
        information is filtered out. In this context, it is easy to
        understand how a senior manager might read this PowerPoint slide
        and not realize that it addresses a life-threatening situation."</p>
      <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
        justify;">"At many points during its investigation, the Board
        was surprised to receive similar presentation slides from NASA
        officials in place of technical reports. The Board views the
        endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical
        papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of
        technical communication at NASA."<br>
