<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Project 4<br>
</h1>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I Heard it through
the Grapevine<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In this
project we are going to do a bit of network visualization using force
directed graphs in processing, increase the size of the source
datafiles to 2 gigabytes, and deal with integrating databases.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></div>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
We will randomize the groups again for this project, so you will be
working with new people.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<div

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In this project we
will be looking at the data that netflix provided for its $1,000,000
challenge. In our case, given a particular rental in their database
that we assume you like, the application should recommend several other
rentals that you should also like based on the ratings of others - ie
given a rental in the database, the system should find all of the other
renters that liked that film and then find all the films that those
renters liked, prioritize them, and display them.<br>
<br>
The data is available at <a
 href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Netflix+Prize">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Netflix+Prize</a><br>
<br>
The files of particular interest are:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">README </span>- always good to start
with the meta-data<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">movie_titles.txt </span>- contains
the 18,000 titles mathed to their ID number which includes movies, TV
shows, etc. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">training_set </span>- directory
containing one file for each title ID showing who rented it, what
rating they gave it, and when they rented it.<br>
<br>
Since there are a lot of films and a lot of renters in the database we
will again start by making some assumptions to simplify things. A
rental needs to have been rented by at least 2500 people to be valid
(which cuts the initial 17,770 titles down to about 5,000.) </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A renter needs to
have rented at least 50 titles to be valid which will help you cut down
the 480,000 renters. <br>
<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></div>
<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For a C you need ...</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>for the given rental (title) you should see the name of the
rental linked
by a force directed graph to n recommended rentals as other nodes in
the graph. Clicking on one of the recommended rentals moves that one to
the center and generates a new set of prioritized recommended rental
nodes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>show the overall popularity of that selected rental(s) as a
percentage of&nbsp; 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 / 1 star ratings</li>
  <li>you should chart the rental popularity of the selected rental(s)
over time - ie how many times was it rented per month over the last n
months</li>
  <li>show the popularity of the recommended rentals (based on total
number of rentals)</li>
  <li>show the quality of the recommended rentals (based on the average
rating)</li>
  <li>the program should start off with a list of the n titles. You can
chose these yourselves and they should show a fair amount of variation
on a variety of variables and include the top rented, top rated, least
rented, lowest rated (from within the subset discussed above.)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For a B you need to add ...</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>clicking on one of the recommended rentals should bring up the
list of n
rentals recommended by that one <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">in addition to</span> the previous
one(s). Rentals that are in common should be more recommended</li>
  <li>a control to limit the popularity of rentals shown. You may find
that very popular rentals overwhelm the more offbeat titles so the user
should have a control that limits the titles displayed to only those
above and/or below a certain popularity level.</li>
  <li>the bad movie version - given a film that the user doesnt like,
use
other renters that didnt like it to find films that they also didnt
like. This implies that your starting set of films should include
several bad ones</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For an A you need to add ...</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>genre data from the imdb database. Combining data from multiple
databases can be tricky but often necessary. We will again limit the
titles to ones that are not videogames, TV shows, documentaries, adult
films, etc. You will need to be a little generous in finding matches
between the imdb and netflix titles, (especially with the use of 'The'
and punctuation.) The imdb will have a lot more remakes with the same
title than the netflix database, but since we are only using the genre
information that shouldn't matter too much. The imdb uses the original
foreign
language title rendered in English while netflix uses the English title
so you will unfortunately lose most of the foreign films, and many
early films, but you should still have a good number of titles to work
with. Once you have the genre information you can use it to label the
various nodes in the graph, and to organize the nodes. Some nodes will
have these labels and some will not.</li>
  <li>decrease the restrictions on number of votes and number of
rentals to be valid - ie increase the size of the dataset that you are
accessing.<br>
  </li>
  <li>use the tool to find some interesting things and document them on
your webpage.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Note that this
project explicitely is not using the prior rental history of the user
to make recommendations. One could choose a user from the database as a
starting point to gain more data to use in creating good
recommendations for that person, but that's a different project. </span><br>

<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
should
create
a
web
page that describes your work on the project. I will be
linking this web page to the course notes
so please send me a 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for the
web. This
should be named p4.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg. Again,
please make
sure that your application is Mac / Windows / Linux compatible. Again,
the web page should describe the contribution of each
team member.<br>
<br>
Each group will bring their visualization to class to present it and
describe
its features to the rest of the
class. This allows everyone to see a variety of solutions to the
problem, and a variety of implementations.<br>

clarification that we are not making use of any past rental history of
the user in the project</span><br>
