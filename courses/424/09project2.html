<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Leaving on a Jet
Plane<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the last decade
more and more tracking data has been made available on the web allowing
people to track cabs, buses, trains, and planes. In this project we
will be looking at real tracking data about flights arriving to and
departing from O'Hare.<br>
<br>
This will be the first group project. Given the quick turnaround time
on these projects you should get your team together quickly and decide
on roles.<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
</span></div>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span>
<hr
 style="width: 100%; height: 2px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Over the summer I
collected a week of data about flights into and out of O'Hare using
data from
www.flightstats.com/go/AirportTracker/airportTrackerUpdate.do?airportCode=ORD.
This
data was collected at 5 minute intervals giving over 2000 files of
data. Each file contains 1 line for each flight either inbound or
outbound at that time.<br>
<br>
The data is located at <a href="data/p2/airport.zip">data/p2/airport.zip</a>
and is 8.4MB as a zip file<br>
<br>
Each file is labelled ORD.month-day-year-hour-minute.log<br>
<br>
and each file contains a number of lines like the following:<br>
&lt;Flight Id="161510335" Flight="BR 658" Airline="EVA Air"
Latitude="60.52" Longitude="-147.49" Bearing="90" IsDep="0" /&gt;<br>
</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></div>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
Each line countains:<br>
</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Flight ID
- unique numerical identifier for each flight</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Flight -
common flight identifier eg UA 124</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Airline -
name of the airline</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Latitude -
current latitude of the flight</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Longitude
- current longitude of the flight</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Bearing -
direction the plane is heading (in degrees)<br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">IsDep -
whether its a departing flight (1) or an arriving flight (0)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As in Project 1 you
will be
creating a web page. The final data download may be a little heavy so
you
should also provide a downloadable version. The application should have
obvious and intuitive
controls.</span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Similar
to
project 1, this application will involve a map and additional graphs
to help the user investigate this data. Unlike project 1, before you
visualize this data you will need to convert it into appropriate
form(s).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><br>
<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a C
you need ...</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>display a useful map of the continental US (could be a vector map
or a bitmap map, and please cite who
made the map in your documentation) with the flights correctly located
(and visible) on the map along with their heading. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">ability to
pick a day and play back an animation of the flights throughout that
day. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">ability to
use the mouse to brush time and see the locations and heading of all
flights in the system at that time. You should be able to
filter those flights by all / inbound / outbound.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">a graph
showing the total number of flights in the air, inbound, and outbound
for each hour of the day and night.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">as with
Project 1, </span>you should check your visualization with a colour
blindness checking web page to see that its ok and <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">the visualizations </span>should
update
quickly when the user interacts</li>
  <li>everything should be well labelled<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a B
you need to add ...</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
<br>
</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">ability to
filter flights by airline (being able to show the flights from any
number of different airlines at the same time)<br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">in
addition to showing the current position of each flight you should also
add the capability of showing the prior flightpaths.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">ability to
compare different days of the week in terms of the number of inbound /
outbound / total number of flights in the air for each hour and the
total for the day<br>
    </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For an A
you need to add ...</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>allow the user to zoom out to a map of the world appropriately
geo-referenced with the flight data<br>
  </li>
  <li>be able to vary the display on the map (geographic features,
political features, minimal features, etc)</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Show an
overall reach of each airline (ie for a given airline show all of the
flightpaths for that airline that are to/from O'Hare)</span></li>
  <li>show the density of flights to/from O'Hare by overlaying a
latitude/longitude based grid over the country/world</li>
  <li>come up with some questions to ask about this dataset, and use
your application to answer those questions.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
One thing to be careful of on this project is the coordinate system of
the map you choose, so you can map the latitude and longiture values
correctly. You may want to look up the coordinates of various cities
around the country / world and make sure they appear in the correct
locations on your map. <br>
<br>
Another thing is the format of the data. There is 8 MB of compressed
data and 51MB of uncompressed data here
(and there will be more data in future projects) so you will need to
massage it into one or more appropriate formats to make it easier and
quicker to visualize. <br>
<br>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As
with
Project 1 you should create a web page describing your work on the
application. This time instead of embedding the processing applicaiton
you should have a link so people can download your application
(and the necessary data files) to run your application. Please make
sure that your application is Mac / Windows / Linux compatible. If you
can get your app to run online through a browser then do include that
version as well. The web page should describe the contribution of each
team member (ie who worked on which interface elements, who worked on
converting the data into a more usable form, etc.)<br>
<br>
Please send me a 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for the
web. This
should be named p2.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg. <br>
<br>
Each person in the group should also send me a private email ranking
your coworkers on the project on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in
terms of how good a coworker they were on the project. If you never
want to work with them again, give them a 1. If this person would be a
first choice for a partner on a future project then give them a 5. If
they did what was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then
give them a 3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a
particular reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine
your responses to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will
average out all these scores for projects 2, 3 and 4 and make those
final averages available to the class and keep them in mind when
assigning
final grades.<br>
<br>
Each group
will present their work to the class and describe
its features to the rest of the
class. This allows everyone to see a variety of solutions to the
problem, and a variety of implementations.<br>
