      will be an individual project to give people practice with writing
      an application in Processing for the wall and get everyone ready
      to contribute to the group projects to come. In this project
      everyone will learn how to get data into processing, how to write
      an interactive processing application, how to create an effective
      user interface for viewing and analyzing this data, and make this
      work on our classroom touch-wall. This will give everyone a common
      basis for communication in the later group projects where people
      will most likely specialize in different tasks.<br>
      <br>
      The project will make use of data from the US Energy Information
      Administration for the years 1980 through 2009.<br>
      <br>
      The data is available from <a

        We are interested in looking at the following data<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Total primary energy production (under Total Energy)<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Total primary energy consumption (under Total Energy)</li>
          <li>Total primary energy consumption per capita (under Total
            Energy Consumption, use the product drop-down menu)<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Total carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of
            Energy (under Indicators, under CO2 Emissions)<br>
          </li>
          <li>Per capita carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption
            of Energy (under Indicators, under CO2 Emissions, use the
            Product drop-down menu)<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Total renewables electricity generation (under Renewables,
            under Electricity Generation)<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        We want to investigate how these values change over time, and
        look at differences among countries and regions of the world<br>

        You will be writing your code to run on the wall in the
        classroom. Solutions that only run on your laptop computer are
        not acceptable. <br>
        <br>
        Details on the Cyber-Commons wall:<br>
        <ul>
          <li> The wall is 8160 pixels wide x 2304 pixels tall</li>
          <li> The computer running the wall is running SUSE-12.1 and
            Processing 2.0a8.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      Your visualization and analysis tool should be written in
      Processing. As this is primarily a graph-based visualization, the
      Milk / Tea / Coffee example should give you a nice head start on
      this. As graphs are a very common visualization this will give you
      a chance to write a set of graphing code that you can reuse and
      improve in future assignments.<br>
      <br>
      You should start by getting processing installed and doing some
      initial tests to load in the data and start displaying it. The
      examples from the Visualizing Data text, many of which are
      included as examples in Processing itself, are a good starting
      point.<br>
      <br>
      You will also need to grab the code we use to interface with the
      wall and its touch-screen. This code makes use of new routines
      instead of the standard mouse routines from Processing. See the
      week 2 notes for the google code <br>
      <br>
      Processing is a multi-platform language but there are some
      differences on different platforms so be sure to test your code
      and make sure that it runs under the same OS as the wall;
      VirtualBox is a pretty nice free emulation solution you may want
      to look into. You may also want to stop by during TA office hours
      and test your code on the actual wall to make sure it works, that
      all the controls and reachable, and that the font sizes, line
      sizes, and colors are appropriate for that size screen and that
      size room. I highly suggest using scaling factors in your code so
      you can scale your solutions from desktop/laptop screen sizes for
      debugging up to wall sizes for your final presentation.<br>
      <br>
      Once you have a basic shell working you should then start to draw
      some sketches of what the interface might look like and how you
      want to arrange and display the data. You can use other software
      to generate statistics about the data if you find that useful but
      be sure to document that process. Be careful of missing data when
      you generate statistics. <br>
      <br>
      Your application should start out showing some data - a blank
      screen is not very inviting. In past terms the students have shown
      a desire to show an overwhelming amount of the data to the user
      right away. You should be careful not to overwhelm the user. As
      Schneiderman said "overview first, zoom and filter, details on
      demand." Appropriate levels of aggregating data will be very
      important here. <br>
      <br>
      It is also important to note that 'getting it to work' is just a
      prerequisite to using the application to find answers to your
      questions. It is that usage that will give you ideas on how to
      improve your app to make it easier and more intuitive to find
      those things.<br>
