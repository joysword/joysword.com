<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Project 2 will be the
first group project and will focus more on represeting data
simultaneously in multiple ways. Given the quick turnaround time
on these projects you should get your team together quickly and decide
on roles.<br>
<br>
You should also very quickly set up a web page for your project and
send the URL to andy. Each Friday of the project each team member
should post on the project web site an overview of what he/she did on
the project that week.<br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

This project will look at data that can be visualized both in a graphs
and in geospatial and temporal forms.<br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As in Project 1 you
will be
creating a web page. The final data download may be a little heavy so
you
should also provide a downloadable version. The application should have
obvious and intuitive
controls.<br>
<br>
Unlike project 1, before you
visualize this data you will need to convert it into appropriate
form(s).</span> <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The data we will
use in this project comes from the US Geological Survey's Global
Earthquake Search site at</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/epic/epic_global.php</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you ask for
spreadsheet format data from the USGS/NEIC (PDE) from 1973 to present
you will get a 30 megabyte comma separated list of quakes that starts
with:</span><br>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Year, Month,
Day, Time(hhmmss.mm) UTC, Latitude, Longitude, Magnitude, Depth</span><br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;
1973,01,01,034609.80, -9.21, 150.63,5.3, 41</span><br
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;
1973,01,01,052229.80,-15.01,-173.96,5.0, 33</span><br
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;
1973,01,01,092857.20,-22.16, -65.79,4.8,205</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
There are over 620,000 earthquakes in this file but some do not have a
magnitude so you should filter out all of the lines that are not
complete. This should leave you with about 500,000 lines of data.<br>
<br>
The tool you develop should help the user investigate questions about
earthquakes. Is there a regular pattern in time between larger
earthquakes? Is there a pattern to the aftershocks of a larger quake?
Are there smaller quakes or an absence of quakes that precede a large
quake?<br>
</span><br>
</div>
<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a C
you need ...</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>plot a world map of the earthquakes with the different magnitudes
colour and size coded (Note you <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">may want to convert
latitude and logitude to another representation, or look at the
different possible representations for converting lat / lon to a flat
map)</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">the world
map of the earthquakes should include a map of the world.&nbsp;<span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There are several map
tools already integrated into processing so take advantage of one of
those and credit them if you do.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">you need
to come up with some appropriate colour and size coding for the quakes.
You might want to start by looking at the Richter Scale page on
wikipedia, but you should also start plotting a subset of the data
quickly to see the distribution so big quakes are visible along with
the much more common smaller ones.<br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">pick a
city from a list of 10 quake-prone cities scattered around the world
and show the locations and magnitudes of all the earthquakes within a
100-km radius over the entire time period. The map tool above should be
useful here as well.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">show a
graph of the number of earthquakes of different magnitudes over the
time range from 1973 to the present, as well as the number of quakes vs
depth, for the world and the chosen city</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">add
another graph explaining the relative power and frequency of quakes of
different magnitudes to help put the data into context</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">you should
check your visualization with a colour blindness tool to
see that its ok</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">everything
should update quickly as you interact<br>
    </span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For a B
you need to add ...</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
<br>
</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">be able to
'play back' time to see the earthquakes over time.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">increase
the number of cities to several hundred (take the most populous cities
around the world) and allow the user to start typing and see the cities
with matching names to pick from</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">be able to
dynamically change the range of time displayed, eg instead of
1973-present, be able to pick a decade, or a year, or several years to
display</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">add to
your graphs the ability to see quakes versus time of day where time is
show both in UTC, local time, and Chicago time. (this doesnt need to be
exactly precise for the local times, but should be within an hour or
two)</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">allow the
user to dynamically change the viewing radius around a particular city</span><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For an A
you need to add ...</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>be able to interactively 'shuffle' through time&nbsp;</li>
  <li>allow the user to mouse over a quake to bring up information on
that quake</li>
  <li>allow the user to bring up multiple cities simultaneously</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">allow the
user to select all quakes of a given magnitude and see them on all the
maps currently visible</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">give the
user a list of major earthquakes and allow the user to select one and
see related data (highlight it on the global map, show all nearby
quakes in the local area, update the related graphs)</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">find some
interesting things in the data and highlight them on your webpage
through screen snapshots</span></li>
</ul>

There is code that integrates modest maps with processing here:

<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As
with
Project
1
you
should
create
a
web
page
describing your work on the
application. This time instead of embedding the processing application
you should have a link so people can download your application
(and the necessary data files) to run your application. Please make
sure that your application is Mac / Windows / Linux compatible. If you
can get your app to run online through a browser then do include that
version as well. The web page should describe the contribution of each
team member (ie who worked on which interface elements, who worked on
converting the data into a more usable form, etc.)<br>
<br>
Please send me a 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for the
web. This
should be named p2.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg. <br>
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When the project
is done, each person in
the group should also send me a private email ranking
your coworkers on the project on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in
terms of how good a coworker they were on the project. If you never
want to work with them again, give them a 1. If this person would be a
first choice for a partner on a future project then give them a 5. If
they did what was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then
give them a 3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a
particular reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine
your responses to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will
average out all these scores for projects 2 through 4 and keep them in
mind when
assigning
final grades to projects 2 through 4.</span><br>
<br>
Each group
will present their work to the class and describe
its features to the rest of the
class. This allows everyone to see a variety of solutions to the
problem, and a variety of implementations. <br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Since we have six groups to go
through in 75 minutes, each group will talk for 8 minutes plus 4
minutes for questions from the other groups. The presentation time
should be evenly split among all members of the group. Each group
sitting in the audience will be allowed one question for the group
currently presenting, so come up with a good one. In answering the
questions the group presenting should be concise so all of the other
groups have a chance to ask questions.</span><br>
