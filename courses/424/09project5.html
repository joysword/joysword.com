The goal of this project is for you to make use of what you have been
learning in this class in a project of your choosing (subject to Andy's
approval.)</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This is a group
project, but this time you get to pick your group and your topic. The
teams can be from size 1 to 3, and the amount of work should scale
appropriately. The
topic and team member choice are due in a week. This should be in the
form of a web page listing your group members and enough detail on your
project that I can review it. You should include </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> information on what
data you are go</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">ing to collect and
how you are going to collect it, or information on where you are going
to get the data from. It should also include some sketches on what the
interface might look like, and what capabilities the user will have.
What questions do you want to investigate with your interface?<br>
<br>
<br>
Some possible ideas:<br>
<br>
- Map the spread of old US TV shows to different countries around the
world - eg how far did 'the A-team' spread and at what rate? I have no
idea if this data is actually available.<br>
<br>
<br>
- One Idea I had laying around for the user interface class was to
create the 'crime computer' for UIC's very own super hero: Spontaneous
Combustion and his/her sidekick Sparky. I think I even have a drawing
of the hero somewhere by former student Arun Rao. Integrating and
visualizing crime data at <a
 href="http://files.chicagotribune.com/metro/crime/">http://files.chicagotribune.com/metro/crime/</a>
among other sites the superhero would know the best times and places to
patrol.<br>
<br>
<br>
- You could visualize your own email connections for the past few years
as a social network graph.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Similar to the imdb viz, you could do a visualization of all the
music files you carry around with you and listen to, with statistics on
genres, years, artists, total, and on a monthly basis.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Mark SubbaRao will supply a data set with Emission Lines for
Galaxies. More data is available <a href="./Emission_Line_Galaxies.pdf">here</a><br>
the complete dataset (137 MB)is available at <a
 href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/%7Esubbarao/AndyJ/">http://astro.uchicago.edu/~subbarao/AndyJ/</a><br>
and a paper talking about the plots is at <a
 href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607311">http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607311</a><br>
<br>
<br>
- MIT's Reality Mining project might be a nice dataset to look at: <a
 href="http://reality.media.mit.edu/">http://reality.media.mit.edu/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
- There are an increasing number of exo-solar planets that have been
discovered with information about the size of the planet, its orbit,
and the kind of star it orbits, which would allow comparisons to our
solar sysem, and overal statistics - http://exoplanet.eu/<br>
<br>
<br>
- The enron email dataset is available if you want to do more
social-network related work: <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/%7Eenron">http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/%7Eenron</a>
and <a
 href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/sims/philpot/data/enron-mysqldump.sql.gz">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/sims/philpot/data/enron-mysqldump.sql.gz</a><br>
<br>
<br>
- The data for Target and Wal-mart store openings in the US is
available onlike at&nbsp; <a
 href="http://flowingdata.com/2009/10/22/target-store-openings-since-the-first-in-1962-data-now-available/">http://flowingdata.com/2009/10/22/target-store-openings-since-the-first-in-1962-data-now-available/
</a>- maybe
that could be combined with population data to look at
average distance to a store, or demographics of the areas where stores
are opened.<br>
<br>
<br>
- There are a variety of movie related drinking games on the web where
every time you see event X or hear someone say Y you take a drink (eg
every time Rambo shoots someone, or everytime someone says 'may the
force be with you.') One could similarly chart each time these events
occur on a timeline of the film to look for patterns and differences
between different films. This one may require more personal research
time since most of these events have not been time-coded. You could do
something similar for episodes of a TV series over a season or follow a
sptrs team through their season. <br>

<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
should
create
a
web
page
that
describes
your work on the project. I will be
linking this web page to the course notes
so please send me a 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for the
web. This
should be named p5.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg. Again,
please make
sure that your application is Mac / Windows / Linux compatible. Again,
the web page should describe the contribution of each
team member.<br>
<br>
Each group will bring their visualization to class to present it and
describe
its features to the rest of the
class. This time there will be two
presentations. The first is a short interim presentation before
Thanksgiving to get some feedback on your design and the current
implementation from the class. The final presentation is during the
final exam period.<br>
