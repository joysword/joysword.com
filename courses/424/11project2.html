      project and will focus more on processing and visualizing textual
      data.<br>
      <br>
      You should also very quickly set up a web page for your group
      project and send the URL to andy. Each Friday of the project each
      team member should post on the project web site an overview of
      what he/she did on the project that week.<br>

    <div style="text-align: justify; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In this project we are going to make
      use of textual data - in particular we are going to focus on
      transcripts of the six seasons of Futurama episodes available at
      http://theinfosphere.org/Episode_Transcript_Listing<br>
      <br>
      In a larger sense these scripts give a textual representation of
      reality which is easier to parse and generate statistics from
      compared to looking at the video and listening to the soundtrack,
      but may not give a completely accurate version of reality.<br>
      <br>
      We will use the script data to create an interactive visualization
      to explore how often various characters appear, which characters
      appear most often together, and what their most common sayings
      are. The script data are in the form of html files which you can
      parse to get the dialogue for each character, eg.<span
        style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></span>
      <br>
      <pre><b>Leela: Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.</b><br></pre>
      (note the first few transcripts have timecodes but the rest do
      not)<br>

          </li>
          <li>pick a character from a list of characters, where the
            common characters are easier to pick, and see which episodes
            that character appears in over the entire series and how
            many episodes that character was in on a timeline of the
            episodes<br>

          </li>
          <li>be able to pick a common character phrase and see in which

          </li>
          <li>show which characters commonly appear together</li>
          <li>use your interface to investigate important questions such
            as how often does Prof Farnsworth say "Good news everyone!",
            what episode was the first time he said it, and does he say
            it more often than Bender says "Bite my shiny metal ass."?
            and highlight them on your webpage through screen snapshots</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Wikipedia has a good Futurama page that will provide you with
        some general information about the show with reference material
        and a nice character page with images. Be sure to cite any data
        (including the transcripts) or images that you use in your work.<br>
        <br>
        Note that the seasons have different lengths so you should take
        that into account when doing your statistics. A character should
        appear in the database if he/she/it has dialogue in more than
        one episode.<br>
        <br>
        There may be some formatting errors in the text files (a common
        real world data issue) so be sure to check your statistics to
        make sure they make sense.<br>
        <br>
        You will very likely want to divide up the work in your group
        between parsing the text, generating appropriate statistics, and
        then visualizing and interacting with those results. It will
        help to agree early on what the intermediate data formats will
        be so work on the different parts can proceed in parallel.<br>

      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">As with Project 1 you should
      create a set of web pages describing your work on the project and
      containing a working applet that has a max size of 1024 x 768. The
      web pages should also describe the contribution of each team
      member (ie who worked on which interface elements, who worked on
      converting the data into a more usable form, etc.) Your team
      should create a 2-3 minute youtube video showing the use of your
      application including narration with decent audio quality. That
      video should be in a very obvious place on your main project web
      page.<br>
      <br>
      Please send me a 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for
      the web. This should be named
      p2.&lt;someone_in_your_groups_last_name&gt;.jpg. <br>
      <br>
      When the project is done, each person in the group should also
      send me a private email ranking your coworkers on the project on a
      scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in terms of how good a coworker
      they were on the project. If you never want to work with them
      again, give them a 1. If this person would be a first choice for a
      partner on a future project then give them a 5. If they did what
      was expected but nothing particularly good or bad then give them a
      3. By default your score should be 3 unless you have a particular
      reason to increase or decrease the number. Please confine your
      responses to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and no 1/3ds or .5s please. I will
      average out all these scores for projects 2 through 4 and keep
      them in mind when assigning final grades to projects 2 through 4.<br>
      <br>
      Each group will present their work to the class and describe its
      features to the rest of the class. All team members are expected
      to participate equally in that presentation. <span style="color:
        rgb(255, 255, 0);">Since there are 9 groups each talk will be 4
        minutes long. During each talk each group in the audience should
        write 1 question for the speaking group, and hand it to them at
        the end of their presentation. The speaking group should add a
        page to their website by Thursday 10/13 giving the questions
        (and the group who asked it) and an answer to the question.</span><br>
