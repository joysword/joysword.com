<div

1
will
be
an
individual
project
to give people practice with writing an application
in processing and get
everyone ready to contribute to the group projects to come.<br>
<br>
The project will
focus on looking at household utility data - which could either be used
to decrease waste or to cyber-stalk someone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Below you will find a link to a table
containing 11 years of data on:<br>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li>Year</li>
  <li>Month</li>
  <li>Average
temperature (according to the comed)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Electricity
Usage
(kWh
/ day)</li>
  <li>Natural
Gas Usage (therms / day)</li>
  <li>Water Usage&nbsp;
(gallons / day)</li>
</ul>
The data is available
here: <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/491/10p1/data.csv">http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/491/10p1/data.csv</a><br>
<br>
In this case the data is already pre-processed to be an
appropriate size and in an easily readable form. That won't hold true
for the later
assignments. <br>
<br>
Electricity is
typically billed once a month, but typically every other meter reading
is
an estimate. Water is typically billed every 2 to 3 months, and natural
gas every 1 to 2 months. This makes it harder to see short term trends,
but longer term trends should still be visible.<br>
<br>
The temperature
data in the file comes from the electricity company. The data seems
reasonable but you might want to get temperature data from
another source, and probably in addition to the average also look at
the
minimum and maximum.<br>

You should start
by looking at data itself and do some simple plots in your favourite
spreadsheet / plotting program. There will be some obvious cyclical
patterns such as air conditioning driving up electricity usage
dramatically in the summer and the furnace driving up natural gas usage
dramatically in the winter.<br>
<br>
Your job is to
look beyond the cyclical patterns for longer term trends and
aberrations that are hiding there, and see what changes in the real
world could have caused them. Some of these changes are related to how
hot a summer was or how cold a winter was, others are related to human
behavior. This is where the cyber-stalking / privacy issues part of the
project comes in. If you have access to this utility data and can
filter out the repeating patterns, and the general environmental
changes, can you find interesting events or trends that tell you about
the people? <br>
<br>
The goal here is to create an interactive visualization tool to aid in
your analysis and to back up any conclusions you draw. <br>
<br>
Here is some more data that will help you with this:<br>
<br>
- The house
stayed basically the same throughout the 10 years of data collection.<br>
- The house uses
electricity to run the air conditioner for cooling, and to run the
blower on the furnace for heating<br>
- The house uses
gas for heating and cooking, and drying laundry<br>
<br>
<br>
I did some
roough measurements of my electricity usage recently:<br>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li>Electronic
gear (computers, TV, videogame consoles) 4.5 kwH / day <br>
  </li>
  <li>Cooking
&amp; Cleaning 3.5 kWh / day</li>
  <li>Furnace
fan (not counting air conditioning) 2 kWh / day</li>
  <li>Pond hardware
2 kWh / day</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
In a common
house:<br>
</div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li>taking a bath takes 50 gallons</li>
  <li>taking a shower takes 2 gallons per minute</li>
  <li>flushing a toilet takes 3 gallons</li>
  <li>a dishwaser uses 20 gallons</li>
  <li>a top loading clothes washing machine uses 60 gallons, a front
loading machine uses 30 gallons<br>
  </li>
</ul>
This data should
allow you to break up the daily usage of two people into components
that can vary
over the months and years.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some of
the dates things that might affect the utility usage<br>
<ul>
  <li>April 2000
- Started an outdoor pond (400 gallons)</li>
  <li>June 2000
- Replaced the air conditioner<br>
  </li>
  <li>April 2002
- Enlarged pond (total of 650 gallons), had major infection in pond
fish requiring many water changes</li>
  <li>July 2004
- Installed new programmable thermostat<br>
  </li>
  <li>July 2006
- 2 week trip out of the country</li>
  <li>Fall 2006
- Started using mulch and less water in the garden</li>
  <li>2007 -
Replaced incandescent bulbs with CF bulbs</li>
  <li>July 2008
- 2 visitors for a month</li>
  <li>March 2008
- Replaced top loading clothes washing machine with front loading model</li>
  <li>September
2009 - Doubled the insulation in the attic</li>
  <li>December
2009 - New high-efficiency furnace and water heater</li>
  <li>June 2010
- 2 week trip out of the country</li>
</ul>

<div
 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
will
very
likely
need
to
look
up some other reference material on the web about
water, gas, and electricity usage. I did. I also found that some sites
over-inflate the usage numbers by 50 to 100% compared to the numbers
that I was able to measure. Those numbers also depend quite a bit on
where you
live and the size of your home. I would recommend looking at a few
different sites to get a better feeling about what good average numbers
might be. Be sure to cite the websites that you use.<br>
<br>
Your
visualization and analysis tool should be written in processing. The
Milk / Tea / Coffee example should give you a nice head start on this.
You should start by getting processing installed and doing some initial
tests to load in the data and start displaying it. You should then
start to draw some sketches of what the interface might&nbsp; look like
and how you want to arrange and display the data. How are you going to
make use of the screen real-estate?<br>
<br>
You can use other software to generate statistics about the data if you
find that useful. The data here is the kind of thing you would
typically see in a graph which is probably a good way to visualize it,
and this will give you a chance to write a set of graphing code that
you can reuse in future assignments since graphs are so useful.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
The application you create should help the user perform the following
tasks:<br>
<br>
Task #1 -
document the repeating seasonal utility usage patterns and what affects
those
patterns (e.g. temperature)<br>
<br>
Task #2 - given
the results from task #1, document the long term trends and short term
variations in those patterns (e.g. given temperature readings you
should be able to work out expected values for
gas and electricity usage, and then any variation you see might suggest
a human cause).<br>
<br>
Task #3 - given
the results from task #2, try to see if the events listed above had an
obvious affect. Also look for other possible affects on the data. Are
there
other dates where interesting things happen?<br>
<br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Bonus Task #4 - predict Andy's
average daily electricity, natural gas, and water usage for the next 4
months of the table. The table of data ends at July 2010. Predict the
values for the next four rows: August, September, October, November. At
the end of the course we will see who was the best predictor.</span><br>

You
should
create a web page that describes your work on
the project including an
embedded processing window (with a max size of 1280 by 700) and a link
to a gzipped file containing the
source code and all other necessary files to make it run locally. This
well
organized page should function as a README file and describe the
featues that
you implemented along with any special features that you added. It
should include screenshots of all the major features. <br>
<br>
I will
be
linking this web page to the course notes
so please send me a nice 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for
the
web. This
should be named p1.&lt;your_last_name&gt;.&lt;your_first_name&gt;.jpg. <br>
<br>
Web pages like this can
be very helpful later on in helping you build up a portfolio of your
work when you start looking for a job so please put some effort into it.<br>
<br>
We will take one class period to look through these visualizations so
everyone can see a variety of solutions to the
problem, and a variety of implementations. You will be expected to talk
about your work.<br>
